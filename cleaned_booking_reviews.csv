8,i liked the room and air conditioning wasnt a big room but it had everything i needed also the staff wa very helpful and attentive this actually blew me away because i really wasnt expecting it wa really nice to see they all helped me with any concern and need i had and showed a genuine interest in doing so keep up the great work a little noisy near my room and also there were some building noise but nothing major i think it just need some updating
6,the staff were fabulous in the reception area the room wa a deluxe double and we were put at the back of beyond in the basement with no window bit disappointing there wa no soundproofing a stated you could hear everything from other room tv to everydoor opening and shutting we only spent time in the room from 930 pm and 9 am the room wa a bit dingy but clean
7,facility were good and staff were very friendly even decorated our room for our anniversary celebration we opted for a double deluxe room we discovered when going to bed that it wa two single bed pushed together with a cloth covering over to hide the gap but once laying down you can feel the dip this wa rather uncomfortable but it wa too late in the night to ask for another room and didnt want to waste the night trying to sort it wa the only let down

8,location bed shower the bath towel were smallest ive ever had in a nice hotel would not wrap around your body i asked for more which they happily provided but they were same size i am 5 foot 2 inch and 8 stone so wasnt asking for much

8,very friendly helpful staff there were 4 member of staff in reception when we got there so they were very quick to get u checked in one of them showed u to our room we turned up about 115 werent meant to be able to check in until 2 but the room wa all ready it wa a really hot day theyd put the air con on to cool the room down which wa really nice we booked a deluxe room which wa very nice but quite small there were bottle of water coke in the room which were free there wa also a small bottle of wine but we didnt know if it wa free so we left it there breakfast wa a full english that you help yourself to the chef wa happy to cook the egg the way you wanted them check out time wa midday which wa great a it meant we didnt have to rush off the hotel is only 2 minute walk from earl court tube station so a really good location the only drawback wa that the fridge in the room didnt work so we couldnt keep anything cold we did report it when we arrived but it didnt get fixed
8,great location close to earl court tube very friendly staff very clean 12 noon checkout is helpful bar close very early which is frustrating more tea bag should be left in room but the team will bring you some up breakfast is buffet style and at time wa getting cooler

7,good location bedroom wa a good size for london and very clean cant really complain about anything we got a very good rate when booking so the hotel wa well worth it if i had booked at a later date with the price that were quoted i oiled be a bit more critical all in all though a good hotel for a couple of day in london
8,the location wa great super easy access to earl court tube station and plenty of food option but quiet and safe the staff were very friendly and helpful they were always smiling and welcoming u back or sending u off in the morning telling u to have a great day we were early arriving and they had our room ready with very little wait and tagged our luggage to hold so we could go on out and explore if we wanted to they also accommodated our request to have three room together prior to arriving i had reached out to the hotel with some question and they were very helpful the room were nice on the small side but that seems to be the norm in london and the shower had the best pressure ive ever seen air conditioning wa cool on hot day a luxury we wont take for granted after other place we visited on this trip i would stay here again and definitely recommend it breakfast wa not great no a la carte option and the buffet wasnt very well stocked the day we gave it a try everyone wa doing their best and the host wa very pleasant when we were leaving he told me they had just brought breakfast back recently since before covid so they might still be working out the kink and everywhere we went in england place seemed to be short staffed also if youre a coffee drinker the coffee in the room is instant it did the trick but there are a few good option on earl court if you need the real stuff

7,if youre not concerned about having free wifi then this ought to be the perfect hotel in every other aspect a i found my stay extremely pleasant not only wa the location perfect given the straight train from heathrow airport to earl court via the piccadilly line and the hotel itself being a very short walk from the tube station the room wa also very spacious had everything you could need and very affordable too also breakfast wa pretty great i did not find myself bored of it in the six day spent there a for the wifi not only wa it a free one that anyone could connect into it wouldnt allow me to use many apps including social medium nor visit many website beyond googlebasic function i have no idea why this is the case but upon relooking at review with specific mention of wifi problem i realized i wa not the only one facing such an issue still give this a 45 overall a i managed without the wifi by paying for my own data service however if you depend on the free wifi you might want to consider staying elsewhere otherwise this hotel is absolutely amazing for it price weak wifi connection

7,located in a short distance from the earl s court underground station and in a nice neighborhood the hotel is a grand old building our room wa at the lower ground floor we had to walk through a long corridor that reminded me of doom video play to reach out room our room had a view to a small and featureless court at the bottom of a deep recess the room wa fine comfortable clean and with modern facility because of the location the room wa dark even when all the light were on and in the morning my suggestion is that the lightening should improve the small court refreshed with some plant box and the carpet on the corridor need to be refreshed renewed the room didnt have any view to anywhere it wasnt cheap for such a location i think future customer should be forewarned if they are booking into this room the room had a feeling of being in a bunker with no access to sunlight albeit a comfortable one
8,great location for access to tube station helpful staff comfy big bed change of towel every day wa a nice surprise bed wa made every day stood on a staplelike bit of metal on the first day near the bed so not vacuumed a well a it should have been would have preferred an extra pillow but none available in the cupboard no plug point around the bed only two by the dresser window not very soundproof could hear noise and voice from the street shower gel not topped up sufficiently

8,although the room wa small it wa clean and quiet the hotel is close to earl court metro station it offer good access to important tourist attraction sainsburys local shop and fast food restaurant are nearby we arrived at the hotel in the morning but the hotel did not provide luggage storage service a in our booking description and we had to pay for luggage storage at a nearby hotel
6,welcoming staff generally had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant breakfast wa a little disappointing a one of the serving staff appeared grumpy when spoken to also after clearing table the waiter took little care in placing crockery and cutlery into cleaning station this caused excessive and unnecessary noise and spoiled our enjoyment he wa the shorter of the two male waiting staff he need to improve his customer service

7,we were upgraded to a much bigger corner room 401 this wa the second time that we had been given an upgrade at the hotel free of charge room window in 401 cant be opened because of security so it smell noticeably more musty and of curry than other room we had previously stayed in in the same hotel staff seem to have trouble communicating with each other and admit a much message are dropped between frontofhouse housekeeping and maintenance once we returned to the room to find housekeeping cleaning it even though the do not disturb light wa on the cleaning lady said she wa told we had requested for emergency cleaning which wa untrue
7,room wa a good size and wa wellappointed with a microwave and comfy armchair on two occasion we left message with frontofhouse eg request for a new tv remote an enquiry about an item that had been left in the room after check out and were told that housekeeping would get back to u but this never happened both time even after checking back with the staff
7,the location is very good a very close walk to earl court tube the dining room is pleasant and the breakfast option were good the room wa fine we had a twin room on the 4 th floor that looked into a small street very pleasant view unfortunately when we arrived 15 hr before check in we were told that we could not drop our bag we had 3 small bag 1 wheelie and 2 carry tog bag this spoiled our plan it wa suggested we took them up to a shop next to the tube station but when we got up there they said they didnt do bag drop this meant we had a wasted uber ride from waterloo since there wa no point heading straight to the hotel and lugging 3 bag to the nearest attraction that wasnt even on our list and then returning a wasted afternoon the lighting in the room is awful the light are either all on bright or off you dont seem to be able to separate low lighting by just turning on a lamp well we couldnt figure out what to do to achieve that pulling the key card out the switch seemed the only option

6,very great location super close to piccadilly line quite even though we had a streetside room big and comfy bed and complimentary coffee tea and water the heating doesnt work properly it is either boiling hot or freezing maintenance came to help but it wa not fixed also we booked this hotel because of location and luggage storage early arrival and late departure from london upon arrival everything wa perfect luggage got stored in secured room but when checking out all of a sudden there wa no luggage storage anymore within the 4 day we were there they all of a sudden changed policy without giving guest notice super weird and not very helpful after a discussion we just had to leave out luggage unattended in the lobby before this incident i would recommend this hotel now not so much anymore pity

7,great location and friendly staff room but gloomy but everything you would want in a bolt hole in central london would stay there again one window in whole room wa a bit gloomy
7,the location wa perfect 5 minute walk from earl court station the bed were comfortable and the room clean and well equipped on the website the room description inluded robe and slipper neither of which were provided also and this could just be me we were provided with two room key one of which turn out to be just a light key not a door key this wasnt explained on reception and consequently we locked ourselves out thankfully a very lovely lady from housekeeping explained and used her master key to let u in

7,location room were very small
7,the staff were very welcoming and i really appreciated the presence of a doorman who carried my big suitcase up the step of the entrance when we arrived the hotel is conveniently located a 3 minute walk from earl court tube station and plenty of small supermarket restaurant cafe and fastfood outlet the cleaner always ensured that toiletry and the complimentary water bottle were fully replaced which i really appreciated and i liked the electronic system for indicating when you wanted the room to be cleaned or not we were on the second floor with a street view which wa pleasant window cant be opened a far a i could tell but the room always smelt fresh despite this the airconditioning worked very well and kept a consistent temperature there is a main panel above the desk in the room which ha socket for all kind of plug and that wa very useful indeed an iron and ironing board a well a a mini fridge were also useful for london the room wa quite a decent size and it wa useful to have a microwave although we didnt use it we didnt have breakfast so couldnt comment on that one lift for a hotel of this size seemed a little insufficient the shower made a strange loud noise when it wa running but other than that it worked well you can hear quite a bit of noise from people in the corridor or adjacent room a well a the street but nothing that disturbed our sleep at any point i have stayed in better hotel for less money in london in the past but maybe i just booked this too far in advance to get a good deal
6,excellent location for transport not good for a group a only very small lounge area with very very low seating
6,location wa ideal very near the tube lot of pub and restaurant nearby breakfast wa good the initial room we were put in wa on the back on the ground floor with load of noise and basically below ground facing a very tall cement wall with all sort of mechanical thing and a very noisy flock of pigeon

8,breakfast wa very good and good value for money the room wa a good size and well equipped the most important aspect to emphasise wa the excellence of the staff who were exceptionally helpful and attentive nothing wa too much to ask reception staff the gentleman at the door and cleaner were all so kind and helpful to u some aspect of decor a little tiredbreakfast available to 1030 am would be nice
6,room wa small but comfortable and had everything needed good air conditioning which wa essential with the weather breakfast wa good quality the staff were a little apatheticnot particularly friendly or customer focused google map took me to entirely the wrong place
6,the hotel wa clean and air conditioning wa good which wa great due to the hot weather reception staff were friendly and helpful breakfast staff were quite rude didnt offer hot drink so we had to ask for this and they didnt provide milk until we asked didnt explain the buffet style breakfast we just had to assume others were able to order other stuff such a hot chocolate and we were not offered this the orange juice wa pretty much empty and not refilled the room had no view which wa not explained pre booking felt like we were in the basement
6,fair better breakfast
7,generous sized room lower ground floor no outlook
7,great location near tube station great breakfast and nice staff small room partly underground
7,quick check in we did not use the breakfast facility a we needed a break from all previous hotel breakfast offer we had problem with the wifi reception partly the wrong information wa given at the beginning
7,easy access to tube and walking distance from south kensingtons local attraction there are many a lot of delicious food place nearby too the staff were helpful and the room wa comfortable the room and bathroom were clean the accommodation also felt quite secure overall very nice stay the room were not soundproof could hear people walking outside the hallway and in other room
7,the location wa close to transit and easily accessible it an older hotel and the bathroom could use an update it clearly well used
7,well located 3 minute walk to earl court underground the hotel offer comfortable and clean room the staff very polite and helpful we stayed the first night in a room on the ground floor not really a nice place to stay but then we asked the reception to change for a better one and they put u on the 5 th floor much much better
7,during my stay i first wa in another location of the city i decided to come closer to the center and the hotel wa perfect for that the staff wa very helpful and accommodating from the the first second till after the checkout special mention to anna from the front desk who wa thinking about every detail that could concern guest comfort the breakfast wa good and varied very close to public transportation restaurant cafe etc nothing noticed but it wa a short stay

7,nice room on 5 th floor small window but adequate a quiet area with very little street noise facility in the room were good with an excellent hairdryer and tea and coffee making facility generally had everything we needed for a short stay onsite restaurant which we didnt make use of a lot of great place to eat nearby only one lift for quite a large number of room didnt like that we were upgraded to a larger room 2 floor down with no natural light although the room were large we didnt know if it wa day or night
7,the air conditioning wa great to have the room wa clean and quiet the location wa great lot of excellent restaurant nearby it is just step from the earl court tube station we walked all over from here felt very safe the room are just like the picture and even though the room and bathroom are small the space is well designed and doe not feel cramped the shower wa very good the mattress in room 001 need to be replaced or need new support the middle and head end seemed sunk down but not really uncomfortable should be fixed though it is kind of a maze to get to some of the room and they dont let you walk through the restaurant which would be easier i understand that with luggage it would be a problem to walk through the restaurant but once you are settled you might eat at that restaurant if you were allowed to walk through it

6,the staff but two in particular stood out rencila who helped loved u we were originally put in a basement room which i wasnt mad about a claustrophobic she could have left u where we are but went out of her way to help and moved u up to fourth offer she also unprompted offered u bottle of water before we headed off and wa so courteous and friendly which for me make all the difference to a stay rinish wa also exceptionally helpful with our bag and obliging he saw me struggling with a clothing tag and promptly went to get me a scissors again he could have easily done nothing but went out of his way the hotel had good location but it not the building that shine it the helpful staff but particularly the lovely rencila and rinish basement room with little or no window awful if you are in any way claustrophobic breakfast quality not great

7,the location near earl court underground station is a real bonus we found good reasonably priced restaurant nearby the outside window in the room did not fully close this made it a bit drafty on occasion
6,the hotel is close to earl court tube station which make moving around the city easy the room wa clean and spacey with a nice bathroom the room window wa stuck due to it being wooden and old it required attention not to get my finger hurt

6,the staff were very helpful and polite the location wa very good the room were expensive and basic
6,the staff were so friendly they went above and beyond to ensure our stay wa lovely the breakfast wa really nice too room clean bed wa very comfortable none
6,we did not have breakfast at the hotel but rather bought from the local shop there are plenty of alternative in the earl court area the restaurant at the hotel did however convey a perfectly respectable impression so i would per se not hesitate to go there we did not really stay long enough and spend enough time in the hotel to find any downside the one thing we find to remark on wa that the room only had one tube of conditioner but if that is the only complaint i think the hotel ha generally done well
6,very convenient to earl court station lot of eatery and essential although we were upgraded to a larger room the king bed 2 twin pushed together it appeared were a bit worn and saggy
7,great location 3 min walk from earl court underground station good breakfast to start the day clean and perfect for a few night in london stored our luggage after we checked out so we could enjoy our last day without lugging bag around there is not anything i can think of that we didnt like
6,the location is nice and plenty to do and see within walking distance the staff are very friendly and overall the hotel is clean a very loud boiler noise started behind the wall at 6 am and continued all morning which wa annoying

7,great location less than 5 min walk from earl court underground room very clean and well appointed with fridge microwave good bathroom with bath and shower would stay again if it wa less expensive bed too small bed regular 4 ft 6 double wa ok but could do with warmer bedding tight squeeze between bed and window cost of breakfast not included hotel expensive

6,location wa good for access to transport system and close to major museum attraction i ate in the restaurant for two of my three night and found the food choice and quality good the checkin staff were very courteous and friendly the room wa clean quiet and well equipped with microwave mini fridge safe and coffeetea facility and the bottled water wa replaced daily the double bed wa comfortable the bathroom wa spacious and the shower wa very good the room size wa adequate for one person but would be somewhat cramped for a couple there were no chair only two stool and a small desk on which to read or write or use a laptop a rather impractical washbasin made even the simplest washing tricky without splashing the floor and surroundings
7,modern building in a great location within 5 min walk from underground station which made getting to london site very easy we felt very safe in the earl court area close to pharmacy grocery and convenience store plenty of food option for any meal of the day including pub restaurant coffee shop fast food etc luggage storage wa a big help housekeeping service were timely and thorough throughout our stay the property is pretty well kept and very clean honestly most of the front desk staff did not give off the most welcoming feeling whenever we passed through the lobby they seemed to be talking to each other in a low voice or sometimes just silent not even acknowledging u which wa noticeable and offputting in such a small lobby a small number of staff were more welcoming and open our flight wa arriving at 6 am so before we arrived i had emailed ahead asking if luggage storage wa available which it wa but also wa told we could check in early if the room wa ready when we arrived i received a very quick reminder that check in wa at 2 pm no let me check if any room are available for you or i apologize but we are unable to check you in early which would have sounded a lot friendlier

6,the bed were very comfortable and the shower wa great overall our stay wa fine the room and facility are becoming quite dated and could do with a revamp the staff at the front desk wa very nice but i wa not too happy with the service we received for example i asked three time for some water glass which were missing from our room and wa always told that they were on their way they never came and we stayed at the hotel for four night i would expect more from a hotel like this
7,all staff inon reception were professional and friendly they always greeted u and checked all wa well the lift wa roomy enough for people plus their luggage the room wa very clean and warm with generally good facility item were replaced daily including bottled water the location wa handy for the tube there were several good pub and restaurant nearby too some museum were within walking distance 20 min the cover for the duvet had enough overhang at each side of the bed to be tucked in but it wa a bit annoying that the padded duvet inside it wa literally the same width a the bed a narrow double meaning it wasnt actually wide enough to comfortably cover u both whilst we were in the bed

7,very friendly staff who are happy to help with whatever you need the hotel wa classy and the room wa good the bed wa especially comfortable and i had a great sleep the restaurant is also a gem and i thoroughly enjoyed the food which i would recommend to any guest staying at the hotel although the room wa clean and in good condition there wa possibly some dust in the room or something that could affect people with allergy
7,location wa really good about a 3 min walk from earl court station and plenty of food option nearby staff were exceptional very friendly and professional especially anna who made sure that everything went right during our stay the room is equipped with microwave fridge tv kettle and thing like water bottle tea coffee were replenished daily the room are a bit outdated and a few thing were broken mainly in the bathroom towel rack wa loose soap holder wasnt screwed in so it would move and almost fall every time you needed to take the soap singleply toilet paper of extremely bad quality the hair dryer wa plugged directly in the wall under the coffee table in the room and you couldnt take it to the bathroom where most people would want to use it you couldnt open the window due to the handle being broken throughout the entire stay there wa a persistent smell in the corridor and the room sort of like musty tobacco which we couldnt get rid of due to the window issue mentioned above
7,from the moment i stepped inside the staff were super helpful especially rohan faheem anna and ali they showed me sample room and assisted with the room booking the room i wa given wa large for london and clean and comfortable the location wa perfect only two minute walk from earl court tube station if i had to find a negative comment the pillow were too hard

7,great location for underground and several bar etc close nothing
7,good location for our arrangement friendly staff and nice sized room had a very nice meal at turmeric kitchen in hotel and good breakfast would recommend would rather have had a non disability bathroom but we arrived early and assume this one wa available
6,i booked a four night break to celebrate my partner birthday elis the receptionist wa very helpful and friendly she upgraded our room and sent up some wine breakfast wa good location wa 2 min from earl court station i booked this hotel because of the review and it stated the the room had sound proofing this wa clearly not the case we were awoken several time on the first night by the person in the next room slamming door and talking which we could clearly hear we had the same thing on the last night also we found stain on the carpet which had a gap next to the wall the window were dirty there wa a spare bed and mattress stored in front of a window in the hallway we found the menu very limited if you dont like indian cuisine it wa nice to have complementary soft drink in the room but no bottle opener provided we felt the hotel wa in need of an upgrade and a bit more attention to detail wa needed
7,close to the station friendly and helpful staff who arranged taxi for u nice bathrobe and slipper to use had a weird skylight in our room that looked like it wa taped up with masking tape

6,excellent location near earl court station the second room we got wa decent the first one see below we arrived quite late in the evening and apparently the hotel wa fully booked so we got the absolute worst room in the building i wont post picture of the view and where it located but that room should not be available for paying guest im not picky in fact the staff also seems to be well aware of how bad it is because the next day we were given a decent room without even asking on one hand it nice of them to rectify the situation but on the other hand taking money for a room like that is quite shady
7,location dusty
7,the location is fantastic it is very close to the tube the staff is friendly and helpful and sorted a problem in the bathroom right away breakfast wa ample and good our room wa a bit difficult to get to one ha to go up and down some step and corridor definitely an exercise for navigating but not a big deal

7,a very quiet but convenient location offering comfortable room and a good breakfast facility room are a little small and more thought could be given to the positioning of the wardrobe right next to the bed which make for a tight space with difficult access to the cupboard and hanging area opposite the end of the bed next to the desk would be a better place for the wardrobe with the tv on an angled bracket next to the bed or over the desk think about it please

7,very clean and comfy bed not the best breakfast i have had coffee a bit to be desired and orange juice glass are small

7,положительный отзыв отсутствует had to ssk 5 time for coffee at breakfast
6,the price location
6,the proximity to place wa great no water given after the 1 st day and housekeeping not properly done bedsheets should be changed at least after 3 day i had trash on the table that wa not taken out for day food i had eaten
6,the breakfast were very good no lounge or seperate leisure room gym could do with update
6,location looking tired in place and room very small
6,location wa good bed werent great decor wa a bit tatty but the place wa good overall
6,good place where to stay close to the tube you can easily reach the main location in london the room wa clean even if quite small the staff friendly and accommodating good breakfast option there is no possibility to leave the luggage once you checkout and come later to bring them back the room especially the bathroom wa very small
7,location to tube line on a one way street so traffic noise wa minimal it could be cleaner in some area
6,staff wa super kind let u check in early and check out late location is good room small bed could use a new mattress cleaning could have been better gym wa well very 90 s bfast wa solid
6,being close to earl court station anna wa helpful ay the front desk i found the staff not very friendly or professional very inexperienced to be working in the hospitality industry especially considering i wa staying at well known hotel chain being the park grand
6,we are a returning guest at park grand and for u the location is perfect earl court tube literally on the doorstep the hotel is always welcoming and staff are very attentive the breakfast offer a fantastic choice too unfortunately the room let u down a little this time we were on the 4 th floor and just before 6 am each morning we stayed 2 night a generator of some sort clicked in it wa a constant drone so no chance of a lie in that said the room wa clean spacious and the bed wa comfy i just think we fell unlucky with the position of the room
7,great location near earl court tube station well appointed updated hotel in an restored building staff very pleasant perfect for walking to sight or catching tube room comfortable and bed wa fantastic nice bath area good seating for relaxing a well would stay again room wa on ground floor with window on sidewalk very noisy no other room available since we checked in late disappointing
8,localization breakfast attention from staff bed the fact you cant leave the lugagge overnight if you are travelling other place from london
6,reasonable price and near tube looked posh in picture friendly staff on arrival we were upgraded to a bigger room but underground with no window we moved to a smaller room with a window the bed had hair in it when we pulled back the cover housekeeping wasnt available but the front desk guy sorted u out and recovered the situation
7,the location wa excellent just a min walk from all amenity along with the tube station and all the staff wa really helpful and supportive especially dinesh if i could recall room size are very small i had to request a bigger room for which the staff did support but in lower basement
6,the hotel is very well located a short 3 min walk from earl court making it easy to arrive from heathrow a well a transit into the city considering the cost of hotel in london i would say this hotel is decent value and the staff were very friendly overall our stay wa good but on the last day we asked the hotel to call u taxi to go to waterloo station i specified there are 10 of u and they quoted u 60 which i would assume is the total cost for 2 car but the taxi company named south kensington taxi charged u 110 for both car which wa outrageous for a ride into the city and they were extremely rude i provided the feedback to the hotel later and they were apologetic and polite about it a likely they just tried to rip u off a tourist in the end but it put a damper on the end of the trip and i would recommend you use uber if you need a car or ensure the hotel speaks to the driver upon arrival regarding the cost before departure
6,great position clean facility room very small
6,the reception team were friendly the manager on shift wa very friendly understanding and efficient he handled my complaint incredibly well the breakfast service wa good tasty sausage the hotel could do with a freshen up lick of paint change carpet re seal bathroom the basement room were dark and dingy

5,location breakfast wasnt kept full and limited hot selection
2,superclean room good shower comfortable bed i had booked a club double with a super king bed and paid extra for the privilege for a special anniversary trip on arrival we were told we had been upgraded we were shown to an inferior room with a standard double bed whose window looked out on a wall a metre away i reminded the receptionist of my booking of which she seemed unaware and we were finally allotted the correct room however despite the high cost the decor wa dark and dated giving an overall impression of gloom the sink didnt drain well but most annoying were the bedside bright light you could only turn off by taking your door key card out of the slot which then turned everything off breakfast wa uninspired and tiredlooking but the final straw all noiserelated which have lead me to write a negative review which i usually avoid wa the scraping of heavy furniture underneath u the first night way after midnight for an hour the constant loud hum we must have been over the boiler or something and someone having a malfunction with their bedroom door 2 room away the maintenance guy forcibly broke down the door with loud bang heavy drill and terrific noise at 10 pm for about an hour and a half until we phoned the receptionist they did stop then but why didnt they simply use a different door key or something quicker to extract the other guest belonging and fix it in the morning we really felt they should have informed other guest of the problem so we knew what the horrendous noise wa about a it wa quite alarmingnot a happy visit
5,room were tiny we just used hotel a a base didnt eat or drink there size of room we booked a deluxe double but could barely walk around the bed
4,staff were very good even when we complained on our first night out off the three night stay about the constant noise of loudly moving furniture from 4 am room 110 they changed our room a few down 107 which meant we could sleep and said we could have a late check 1230 out to make up for loss of sleep will note the noise wa still around but not all night sadly we feel we were hounded to get out of our room on checkout day we planned to leave at 12 even though we were told it wa changed too 1230 we had a knock on the door asking if we wanted a pillow we had the zzz button on which i then turned off then a little after 11 we had the door bell ring and two male staff were asking why we hadnt checked out we explained we were told because off the night off missed sleep and room change we were told we had a 1230 checkoutthey said ok and we continued to get ready to go then the phone rang and my husband answered and know one spock on other end after 15 min it rang again with the receptionist asking again why we hadnt left it wa before 12 my husband explained again and i wa just done and said we will gowe left room and i took the stair while my husband took elevator when i got to reception i told them i wa very angry with the way we were treated she said we could stay they didnt know we were staying longer i said we have packed and we are going and gave the room key card and we left before we were meant too this spoilt the long weekend my husband had organised for our 22 nd wedding anniversary it should state what room you can hear the restaurant bar furniture moving loudly or you need to soundproof a lot more the noise of road and people outside room didnt dive me mad just the loud squeaking of people not picking up there furniture
4,положительный отзыв отсутствует it wa very loud i assume it wa the air condition the staff wa not very helpful when i asked about glutenfree breakfast option

2,location wa good and close to underground wasnt aware deluxe double wa not so deluxe ended up down a back stairwell next to the bin felt like we were in a service passage had to get past staff on their break sat on the stairwell a couple of time room were very small so little room for case but you would expect this for london this hotel wa labelled a four star but it wa far from it
2,good location near to earl court station in room facility were good given a basement room with no window which smelt damp requested a different room but wa told hotel wa full this wa blatantly not true a room were still available on bookingcom staff not helpful or engaging
5,loved the location well off a main road so traffic noise wa not an issue crystal the hotel handy man wa delightful and very helpful a good ambassador for the hotel deluxe room were larger than most hotel room in london an adjoining room should not be considered a deluxe room noise in the hotel wa a nuisance and that wa more because of inconsiderate guest arriving home late
9,location and the room bathroom tarnished shower house missing a cap just a few wear tear place
5,friendly receptionist who took our bag for safe storage on arrival early and completion of checking in late after concert had finished in the evening given bottled water after none found in room once checked in disappointed with breakfast service staff not offered teacoffee cooked breakfast of poor quality and commented on by fellow guest no poachedfried egg a option and cheap sausage lacking meat table not laid so unnecessary argument with waitress over missing cutlery told restaurant closing 10 minute into meal for a 15 charge way inferior to unlimited breakfast at premier inn conversation with unhappy guest from singapore on adjacent table confirmed they were checking out after just one night in the basement where room had no natural daylight
4,the size of the bathroom and the ceil shower they need to pay more attention to the small detail the billing system for the restaurant and the hotel need to be combined more coordination between the hotel and it contractor the contractor changing the entry key card to the room tried to pressure me to check out earlier more attention and support for elderly no access ramp for disable getting into the hotel need more variety in the restaurant menu need to change the carpet in some of the walkway and room the gym is too cramped
4,the location wa amazing for accessing the kensington area restaurant natural history museum underground and in particular for our trip to wimbledon the bed wa very large and comfortable the hotel wa situated on a lovely quiet street the hotel i felt needed an update the room wa adequate and clean but appeared dated the size of the room wa ok but i would have liked it to have been bigger for a club double room the bar and restaurant did not look inviting and unlike other 4 hotel
5,the location wa perfect for our requirement we booked a superior room i dont expect a superior room to be in the basement with no window
4,staff lovely breakfast good room bit tired tv didnt work shower grouting need addressing just a bit dated but very clean
5,the location is great the decor is very tired there were in hole in the curtain
5,perfect location comfortable clean bed pleasant restaurant and staff and reasonable food we were not expected on arrivalit would appear that bookingcom had not confirmed our bookingwith the hotelthe staff were very helpful and we were asked to take a seat whilst a room wa prepared the room wa disappointing although clean
4,положительный отзыв отсутствует our flight wa delay by a day which i had emailed to say we would be a day later when we arrived the reception staff said oh these are the no show guest which wasnt very friendly we didnt have breakfast any morning because we were not shown anything or even told what time breakfast wa
4,location shortly walk to tube station we upgraded to a club room but were disappointed a the room wa very small and did not include the promised extra robe slipper fruit and extra space
4,location wa good short walk from earl court tube station plenty of place to eat nearby staff we had contact with were friendly and helpful room wa clean plenty of toiletry general decor tired tea and coffee selection in room uninspiring for a 4 hotel breakfast too a little uninspired lacking in choice but what wa there wa okay water machine in reception not working nor wa the coffee machine in breakfast room
5,location staff not a helpful dirty gym with box
4,clean underground bedroom with window onto brick wall stained carpet
4,property wa clean and good selection for breakfast the mattress wa very worn and sunken in the middle and both myself and my husband left with very sore back and slept poorly because of it
5,location wall were paper thin floorboard were creaky you could hear everything your neighbouring room did when they moved room very small and layout poor
3,friendly staff complained about noise coming from air conditioning unit but it wa not resolved cleaner knocked on door two morning when we had asked to not be disturbed
1,lovely hotel and wa really happy with the first night made complaint about the room next door partying playing music really loud and shouting made 2 complaint and wa told other people made complaint hotel staff went and told them of the complaint but didnt do nothing more wa moved room at 0330 to a room adjacent to the high street with noise from moving vehicle being a constant nuisance not a good ending to our stay no sleep and very disappointed in the end wouldnt recommend to anyone
4,close to earl court train station room wa clean we were put on lower level 2 floor down with no lift very long walk down a hallway that smelled like a really bad musty fart no view out of window made for a bad first impression
5,location wa good for earl court underground room wa spacious breakfast wa good would i stay again probably not due to how they treated guest their customer service could do with improvement food at breakfast wa lovely but their service wa appalling

5,location the most arrogant staff member that decided he could speak over me when i made a slight complaint hospitality is not his forte
5,the hotel wa lovely and clean and the staff kind polite and very helpful i loved the addition of a microwave in the room because i wa able to warm meal likewise the biscuit a well a tea and coffee wa a lovely touch i am disabled so i appreciated the comfy armchair a well lastly a good solid wardrobe in the room iron hair dryer and good lighting liked the air com in the bathroom kept the room cool and fresh i felt that the linen could be cleaned more thoroughly because there were a few stain on the quilt cover and general bedding the net curtain should be white not grey the room wa very clean so with these simple addition to the room would make it perfect
5,friendly staff good breakfast problem with mattress which wasnt sorted until day 2
4,location and breakfast our room wa in the basement and did not have window we were not warned about this prior to staying we felt a though for 205 per night which didnt include breakfast there should have been a window in the room

5,very good breakfast the first room i had wa small did not have hot water in the evening and there wa a persistent humming noise emanating from an ac unit upon investigation my room wa upgraded and this room wa excellent
4,breakfast lack of communication very loud pipe that would wake u up early in the morning housekeeping wa average
5,loved the location i walked from here through hyde park to oxford street took the tube from heathrow to earl court station which is really close staff on reception were really helpful a the room layout is super complicated and they were really nice helping me find my room carpet particularly in public area are very stained i wa in room 006 and it wa super complicated to get to signage a bit patch on the corridor housekeeping forgot to give me water on the second night of my stay
4,положительный отзыв отсутствует staff on reception unhelpful staff in reservation unhelpful manager just ignores email and complaint
5,the location wa good for what we wanted easy short walk to the underground the breakfast wa disappointing not a great choice for a 4 hotel the breakfast the restaurant staff werent very pleasant and didnt clear away plate and when they eventually did they stood at the table whilst they scraped all leftover food onto one of our plate rather than just take them away and come back for the rest
4,location is great very close to the metro station lot of pub and food choice in a vicinity breakfast wa nice be super careful with this hotel bc their room guideline are very misleading based on a photo here on booking i made a reservation for a deluxe double room for 4 night what we got wa an underground room with no window and bar on the ceiling above bed we couldnt see them during the night becouse the glass is painted white the room itself wa nice and big but a dungeon vibe were super strong so we complained bc what we paid for definitely wasnt a basement room but a nice room with window a shown on the photo but they didnt have a new room for u on the first night of our stay so we slept with a bathroom light on to avoid the feeling of being burried alive tomorrow they moved u to a room on the third floor and we stayed there for 3 night when i asked for a refund for the first night they said the basement room wa in fact on a ground floor and didnt take my complaint into consideration room without window arent shown on photo or described on the listing and if i had known that there wa a slightest possibility of staying in a basement room for 640 euro i would have never booked this hotel how on earth can you even put a word deluxe near a room without a window if we didnt complain we would have stayed in a basement room for 4 night and they would sell twice the more expensive room so before your arrival be sure to check with fom if your room really is what you paid for
5,the friendliness of staff the location if i knew they the hotel wa in earl court which you dont mention clearly on your site i would have chosen another one
4,the hotel is in a good area and conveniently placed from the tube station and ha a lot of eatery in the neighborhood we are able to get an early checking at 1230 and a late checkout until 2 pm which wa very considerate very basic roomsthe toilet had a smell and the pressure in the shower wa low the biggest problem we had wa that on one evening while my son and i were changing to go put for dinner a male staff of the hotel barged into our roomno knocking he had the key and came straight in saying he wa looking for someonethis left both my son and i shaken up it wa shocking that a man could barge into the room on complaining with the front office the duty manager wa reluctant to share detail of the senior hotel manager and also had a very careless attitude on the matter while i plan to report this to the uk authority i do want other lady travelling alone or otherwise to know that this is something they may want to ve careful about while it may have been in error it clearly show the lack of training of the hotel staff the operation manager whole apologetic said he couldnt do anything until he had proper evidence and would only investigate when he came back after the weekend all sign 9 f how 9 mportant customer safety is to the hotel
5,the room wa nice and a expected staff were not particularly friendly i needed to use a computer for work when i arrived the receptionist allowed me to use the business centre there were 2 computer one didnt work and the other had no mouse i tried to swap it over but it didnt work the coffee machine had no milk there were no cup and the area wa dirty and untidy i just gave up and went elsewhere

4,location room smelled damp and we had a leak in our bathroom asked twice for it to be fixed slipped on last day and mentioned it again at checkout to notify manager not to use this room girl on reception paid lip service and were uninterested we were over for a family wedding and twenty of u booked there poor customer service restaurant team very pleasant and food good despite booking two hour late checkout for 40 pound they called our room and chambermaid barged in and woke u

5,there are 2 very nice light in the restaurant and the food and service for dinner were both very good you need to pick the right table to get away from the drafty aircon but our waiter arranged to turn the aircon down which helped the lamb curry and lamb biryani were the best ive tasted probably one of the best indian restaurant we ever been to shower pressure in our room wa good and the christmas tree in the foyer looked very nice our bed wa comfortable and very big safe worked ok and lot of socket and mirror dotted around the room lot of facility in the room fridge hairdryer and even a microwave room are on the small side a is the bathroom and although the bedding looked fresh a number of somebody elses hair were found when the bed wa inspected there wa no bottled water in the room or in the fridge and tv channel selection wa poor the remote not the best to operate the room thermostat is fiddly to change from cool to heat with very little instruction and the room wa a bit cold until i figured it out the next day breakfast wa ok but basic there a distinct lack of taxi passing by the hotel so you have a short 5 min walk to the busier cromwell road to grab one not too much of an issue for me but when you have a load of luggage and a 77 mum to contend with that could be an issue for others our club room wa supposed to have turndown service which didnt happen nor did the room get cleaned during our 2 night stay the extra pillow i asked for also didnt materialise oh and more importantly the bar wa never open when we came back from a night out it wa closed before 11 pm unless there wa another bar somewhere in the hotelwhich we werent told about wifi speed connectivity wa not the best in our room

5,not much we booked for 2 night and asked for a quiet room when we booked 6 month ago they gave u a room on the road which is very noisy with people all night and early traffic also the room are not sound insulated so you can hear all the door closing and people talking in other room also the window do not seal also when we arrived we noticed that the bed had no mattress protector sleeping on other people body fluid doe not excite told the staff but nothing wa done also the wifi is not password protected so you sign into a security compromised interent beware really only a 2 start hotel with a 4 star price

0,the location i checked in at park grand kensington on the 27 th of may at 300 pm sharp and i wa really astonished by the beauty and the cleanliness of the room exactly how it appears on bookingcom however my room wa facing the staff room responsible for housekeeping and the moment i decided to rest they started continuously chatting out loud joking around laughing really hard talking on the phone loudly with loudspeaker on and it kept on going nonstop i said to my self it alright deciding to be fair and acknowledging that it 300 pm and they do not expect someone to be resting during that time but this is a hotel and they must clearly understand that client arrive at all time tired from long duration flight and would definitely be in need of some rest the next morning on the 28 th of may exactly at 700 am i wake up to the sound of their voice chatting out loud almost screaming so they could hear each other and thats like literally facing my door and it felt like they were with me inside and i couldnt even get back to sleep this morning and stayed tired all day knowing their noise wa not only for a while but wa continuous all morning on my way out i spoke to the lady at the reception and informed them whats going on they apologized and were really nice where they even called the housekeeping team downstairs over the phone and had a chat with them regarding the complaint so that it is not repeated surprisingly they couldnt care less and the same scenario occurred on the morning of the 29 th and 30 th of may consecutively and it even got worse a im getting more tired by the day arriving late at the hotel and having to deal with how annoying they were early in the morning literally at 700 am i wa on a short vacation and stayed at the hotel for three night and honestly it wa my worst experience ever where every day wa totally ruined because of the lack of sleep caused by them

4,the location is amazing close to everything we have stayed in this hotel for the second time and probably the last we were offered an upgraded room which wa located in the basement there wa a bad damp smell there wa a mold on shower door the upgrade referred to it size but to be honest i would much prefer a smaller room with window facing street than window facing the back of the building where all the air conditioning fan system are located one more thing to get to the room you need to pas four flight of stair two going up and two going down no lift
4,bed wa large and comfortable thought it wa overpriced very average place old

5,положительный отзыв отсутствует room were freezing cold
4,the staff despite the nice gesture of having our room upgraded the wooden furniture wa pretty old fashioned and had certainly seen better day for a 4 star hotel in this day and age youd expect a bit better the water pressure in the shower is belowpar to say the least the tv in the room also need to be updated we are in 2022 not 2007 the internet quality is woeful constantly dropping in and out definitely not a 4 star hotel more of a mediocre 3 star hotel the w 14 hotel is a better hotel also better value for money a it is usually cheaper over there overall the hotel is massively overrated and the positive review we read before booking the hotel certainly led u to believe we were actually going to a 4 star hotel the only main positive wa the staff a they were excellent and very friendly
5,room wa very clean and spacious food in restaurant wa gorgeous staff were also very nice we were staying in one of the room which seemed to be based down in the basement floor where the kitchen area wa this part of the hotel seemed a bit grubby compared to the rest a the carpet wa pretty worn and a strong smell of smoke there were a few flight of narrow stair to go down which wasnt ideal with heavy bag the room wa also a bit confusing to find the room itself wa lovely and i couldnt fault it at all

5,good location close to earl court station a bit of a run down property odd odour in the hallway window that didnt entirely close letting street noise through stained carpet and curtain i can generally look past that sort of thing but especially for this price almost 200 pound per night without breakfast i had expected something very different

3,it wa ok definitely not a 4 star in my opinion the room wa noisy and very hot air con wa non existent breakfast wa terrible and area very small very bad customer service
4,bit disappointed with our stay didnt feel like a 4 star hotel provided the following information via email after being asked for feedback but got no reply after our stay in feb 2024 we requested more pillow a the one we had were very flat at the same time we also asked for blanket a the room wa really cold and despite turning the heating up over an hour later we were still cold we waited and waited and had to call reception again regarding this and were advised no blanket but extra duvet were delivered instead this helped but shouldnt have had to ask twice a this wa embarrassing there were 3 of u staying in the room and only 2 teabags provided again had to ask twice for these despite asking at the same time a the blanket need to provide adequate supply for at least 2 drink per person per night the light in the room were a little confusing a there wa a long delay turning them on even the porter wasnt sure when first showing u to our room we had difficulty turning the bedside light off in the evening none of the bedside switch seemed to work turned them off at the door we were too embarrassed to contact reception again a after the second call we didnt feel comfortable doing so even though there is a microwave in the room there is no cutlery or crockery if we were to have used it
4,location near tube station room very small not a clean a expected
2,location wa excellent really easy walk from tube station breakfast wa good quality nicely preset with plenty of choice pleasant dining room room wa smaller than expected hot and noisy air conditioning didnt work room description misleading it mentioned water cooky bathrobe slipper and wine in the room there wa water and cooky on the first night but these were not replenished the next day reception staff could not explain why this wa the policy when both night were charged at the same rate bathrobe slipper and wine were not supplied at all we hung up towel to indicate we would reuse them a requested on a card in the bathroom towel were replaced with new and the soap wa replaced by a new wrapped bar very wasteful
3,the location staff were not pleasant no effort to make small talk when we checked out they did not ask u about our stay the property wa cold we stayed downstairs in the basement and we had to ask for an extra duvet poor placement of heating unit over the wardrobe which meant the room didnt heat up corridor smelt musty someone had spilt soup or something on the carpet and it wa not cleaned up over the 3 day we were there window and outside courtyard needed a clean off the bedroom hotel need updating new carpet on stair and hallway definitely needed poor attention to detail there wa a letter in the room in the welcome book about a fire drill in august 2023 issue with the tv faded strip appearing on the bottom of the screen in room 14
5,location wa ok cleanliness outside hotel room on patio area new room provided which wa in the basement with no window
2,room wa clean comfortable convenient location for the underground staff polite room had no natural light just a window with closed curtain with a wall behind the glass with a florescent tube above a light like sleeping in a dungeon waking up all the time to check the time dreadful we were also told we had been upgraded to bigger room so i dread to think what the smaller one were like room had a nice looking tv but no remote control so useless daughter room the same nothing in the info file to say anything re the tv light by the side of the bed took 5 minute to find out how to turn them off not just me but my daughter had the room next to me said she had the same issue breakfast included in the exorbitant price over 250 room undrinkable tea coffee orange juice made from concentrate cheap generic cereal same for the bread under ripe fruit waste of money

4,the convenient location ac wasnt working it too hot to stay during the day in the room bathroom fitting were broken
3,location is great about 2 minute walk to earl court tube station with direct train to heathrow the doorman sam wa just fantastic he wa so cheerful a is a real asset to the hotel we were moved to a quieter room thanks to the very nice maintenance man no question asked he just moved u immediately i think all the other staff could do with some training in customer service i think it totally unacceptable that staff are on their phone at reception the staff in the dining room have obviously received no training we basically felt we were just an inconvenience when going in for breakfast constantly had to ask for tea and coffee the table were not cleared quickly enough and when we were asked for our room number there wa no good morning or even eye contact basic requirement i think the breakfast offering wa not fantastic and on 2 morning it wa served from a much smaller area not acceptable on checking out the question wa asked if we enjoyed our stay again with absolutely no interest or enthusiasm i replied it wa ok yet again no question a to why it wa just ok this wa a birthday treat but it certainly didnt feel like that i work in the service industry and the level of customer service left a lot to be desired no visible sign of a hotel manager during our stay we stayed at the hotel some year ago it is a little tired
0,location is great 5 min walk to earl court tube station bed werw comfy able to leave bag after checking out reception and concierge staff were friendly the original room we were allocated to 120 had a musty smell and an awful lot of mould around the window i complained and wa moved to a club room 209 which wa a larger room than the original one we booked however is wasnt much better the inside of the shower screen and the shower track were filthy dirty i have stayed here previously but felt that it ha gone downhill and room are in need of a refurb i wouldnt stay again
5,i booked 2 room for family member and myself and although the room were small mine wa fine the other room ha a strong smell of weed when you walked in i think coming from the vent above the bathroom door it wa also quite noisy from some building work being carried out which i think is also where the weed smell wa coming from the bed in the other room wa also a little odd the base of the bed wa bigger than the mattress meaning it stuck out and wa easy to hit your leg on when you walked past the breakfast included in the price wa much better than i wa expecting and much more comprehensive staff on the whole were friendly and nice except the one front desk person who when my sister reported a broken glass in the elevator to asked her a number of interrogating type question and then didnt even clean it up wa a bit of outside noise but this wa mainly caused by one very load romanian family who didnt know how to talk to each other and literally screamed at each other despite being just metre away also a staff member at breakfast broke a glass and then took forever to clean it up she even kicked a very large piece accidentally under our table but didnt bother to clean it until we asked her too she saw that she had kicked it too
2,положительный отзыв отсутствует the room wa not clean i booked a double bed and it wa two single pushed together which kept separating and wa very uncomfortable the window had no handle on them and it wa broken i wa told this wa an upgrade but it wa definitely not

3,certain member of staff were attentive the breakfast staff staff in the indian themed restaurant were rude not attentive to guest on 2 separate occasion our tea coffee order wa incorrect when asked for it to be corrected we were met with an attitude the room itself needed a deep clean heavy dust on all furniture the side of the bath between the hand basin bath panel wa dirty underneath needed a severe hoovering we advised the cleaning staff but nothing had been done even complaining to the reception staff we were met by a dumbfounded look negative response we were situated on the 3 rd floor there wa water coming through the ceiling which resulted in the ceiling paint flaking away into the floor it wa never hoovered on our last day there wa an instant smell of cannabis use the hotel wa noisy late at night early morning bearing in mind this is a 4 star hotel which need immediate tlc it wa not cheap to stay at this hotel i would expect to find these sort of issue in a hostel ive had better stay at a premier inn travelodge i will not return again
1,location wa good and room were tended daily staff appeared to not want to be bothered had to ask for coffee in restaurant after being ignored for ten minute there wa mold in the shower in one room we were put on a lower level with no window there were skylight but they were so covered in filth that little light came through air freshener were used in the hallway to mask the mildew smell
5,th staff were really great and the room wa very clean there wa a noise coming from the bathroom that kept waking u up through the night
4,close to tube and helpful and friendly staff bed wa extremely uncomfortable needed a new mattress and room wa quite dirty in term of stain and mark on wall and black mould in bathroom

4,the breakfast wa good and the location of the hotel wa good i had no hot water pressure so could not take a hot shower for 2 day after the first day i wa told it would be fixed and it wasnt when chatting at reception upon check out they said it is because everyone shower in the morning if i am paying for a hotel room i expect it to come hot water to be able to shower no matter the time of the day or how many people are showering at that moment
4,great location right beside tube statuon inability to leave luggage after checkout and collect later general amenity in room
3,положительный отзыв отсутствует i recently had the unfortunate experience of staying at the park grand london kensington and i must say it left much to be desired here my candid review location and amenity the hotel location just 150 meter from earl court tube station is indeed convenient however the promised amenity fell short the room were far from what id call stylisha disappointment right from the start and let talk about the bathroom it wa tiny lacking any semblance of comfort to make matter worse there were no fan to alleviate the stuffiness elevator ordeal a missed opportunity now brace yourself for the most frustrating part the elevator situation upon arrival i wa informed that the lift wa out of order fine i thoughti can handle stair but carrying my bag up five flight without any assistance wa a letdown and guess what later i discovered there wa a service elevator tantalizingly close yet strictly offlimits to guest the lack of consistency and communication wa infuriating staff interaction hit or miss the staffwell it wa a mixed bag some were friendly and helpful while others seemed indifferent consistency matter especially when youre paying for a comfortable stay recommendation or lack thereof despite the disappointment the park grand london kensington ha potential but management need to step up their game address the communication gap fix the elevator debacle and perhaps invest in room upgrade a little extra effort in customer service can go a long way final verdict proceed with caution in summary my stay at park grand london kensington wa like riding a rollercoasterups and down but mostly down if you can overlook the flaw the convenient location might still sway you but approach with caution remember this review reflects my personal experience and yours may differ safe travel and may your next hotel stay be smoother
1,checking out this hotel is dirty and simply ignores the basic fundamental of running a hotel
4,the position wa great a short walk to earl court in the area there were many restaurant fast food and small market first no other drink other than juice plain tea or coffee were included so you had to pay an additional fee if you wanted a cappuccino never in my life i experienced a 4 star hotel doind this also on the last day we left at 6 a breakfast start at 7 we asked if we could still get something to eat before leaving a the breakfast wa paid they didnt give u anything but of course kept the money honestly disappoing for a 4 star the most outragious thing wa the elevator broke and remained out of order for our whole stay that ment carrying two very big suitcase for four floor they didnt offer any help al all also no smart tv only english channel again disappoining for a 4 star hotel over all not worth the money
2,the bed wa soft and the linen wa clean the shower had sign of mould especially on the overhead shower which i rubbed away some of with a towel the paint and maintenance of the property is poor sadly the room wa musty and a bit weird
3,the location is fabulous literally 2 min walk from earl court tube station great for barsrestaurants and a co op it definitely wasnt a 4 star room wa dirty especially the bathroom mould all down the side of the sinkshower inside the shower wa black mould hair wa left in shower tray obviously from previous guest along the skirting wa filthy it looked like it needed a complete deep clean there wa nowhere to put toiletry the side of the sink wa way too small dressing table wasnt clean at the side something had been spilt but not cleaned up after breakfast wa very basic not much choice no saltpepper pot just satchets which you got yourself no egg other than scrambled not much choice of fruit cereal or cooked breakfast bar wasnt open for resident at night which for a 4 star id of thought it would be the lift broke so there wa no alternative so we had to use the stair with our case to the 3 rd floor there wasnt anybody offering to help with luggage updown the stair especially for those who are elderly when i mentioned on check out about the dirty bathroom receptionist wasnt bothered it obviously went in one ear out the other very sad it not up to a 4 star standard a it in a lovely street and such a great location please sort your housekeeping out very poor

4,it wa close to the earl court station which made it easy to join the city center it absolutely wasnt worth the price nor is it worth the 5 star the cleaning wa okay but there wa a lot of dust which is unacceptable for such a hotel we paid for breakfast and had the surprise that if you wanted a hot drink other than coffee you had to pay very disappointed we wont be back
3,it is at a good location heating wa not switched on even after two call to reception mattress dip down so much that you can feel how old it is unfortunately didnt took shower because of hair already there if you are staying in a room numbered with a single digit then you will have to walk through several step down in the basement and you will see old carpet and a smell

4,the room were really convenient and the location perfect it wa unacceptable that in this price they didnt offer luggage storage for our suitcase and we had to leave them in the entrance without proper safekeeping also although we asked for the manager he never appeared and the staff in the reception didnt even seem concerned or eager to help this is my first time after travelling more than 15 year for both professional and personal reason that a hotel that i have been staying doesnt offer luggage storage for suitcase this wa unacceptable and i would certainly not stay again in the hotel for that reason
2,положительный отзыв отсутствует small bed awful pillow condensation running down the wall rubbish breakfast
5,proximity to the underground internet wa poor signal wa speedy and accessible only at the door of the room move to the actual bed area or desk the signal dropped off tremendously to the point when one couldnt access text nor email i had to ask three time on different day to get extra blanket for each twin bed

5,the location of the hotel is excellent 20 second walk to tube station and plenty of restaurant and bar in walking distance the area wa quiet too apart from the occasional rubbish truck staff wa very pleasant the room wa very small for the price the wall are quite thin too a you could hear every bit of movement in the corridor from your room bit expensive for what it is coffee wasnt included in the breakfast so i had to pay extra for hot drink
5,the location poor breakfast there should be a coffee machine within easy reach of customer for a latte or cappuccino you have to pay extra
3,the location our room wa next to a road and the generator storage room both were noisy the room wa very small and had a green ceiling light on permanently which resulted in the room never being completely dark the teacoffee wa not replenished and access to our room wa behind the restaurant which required going up a flight to come down via the emergency stair which were very dirty
5,i like the location of the hotel the room is dirty and it is very small and when i asked for housekeeping they only come and take the trash and adjust the bed
5,the location is great nice neighbourhood the room are dated i had some fly in the room and the moth wool eating one got rid of it and wa alright generally the cleaning wa not great and a note wa pushed really early on the morning around 7 am that they couldnt clean the room for today so we had to ask every single day to the room cleaned not great
4,friendly staff fair breakfastnewmodern bathroom with good quality fitting plenty of towel and supply in the bathroom dark furniture in the bedroom room looking out to a brick wallsmall supposedly superior room 6 inch gab between bed and wardrobe very tight squeeze i had to walk sidewards along the bed to get to the bathroom have bruise to prove it if required poor quality yogurt and bread at breakfast
3,the helpful receptionist during my recent stay at a hotel initially booked for 5 night i had to cancel the reservation for the remaining 4 night due to a change in my plan upon arrival i explained the situation and the necessary adjustment were made however i wa given a room on the underground floor which presented an inconvenience the layout required taking the lift to the first floor and then walking to the underground area descending to the room from the other end this setup wa not very convenient featuring dirty carpet among the old floor that resembled a fire escape with no sign to guide guest the price i paid for one night 234 felt disproportionately high especially considering the underground room and location additionally the omelet egg i ordered for breakfast were oddly flat differing from what ive experienced in any other hotel overall it wa a unique and lessthanideal experience
3,положительный отзыв отсутствует breakfast is not ok and there is not add drinking water and shower gel in the room

4,location wa perfect for getting around really nice and central to what we had planned the bed were comfortable the place seemed to have seen better day the carpet were old and worn most of the decor and wall were chipped and just a bit shabby there wa mouldy food in the fridge when we arrived which wa very disgusting and just not really acceptable the front desk did offer u a different room however we had already unpacked and settled and couldnt be bothered to repack everything we just asked that they cleaned the fridge out for u which they agreed to do but when we arrived later in the evening the food wa still in there we then took the food ourselves to the front desk and nothing wa offered to make up for this they did not really take responsibility and just blame the cleaning staff the breakfast wa also extremely disappointing i really didnt think you could go wrong with a breakfast buffet but i am wrong everything wa over cooked and just bland the juice werent re filled and the water even tasted a bit off really not what i expected from a 4 star hotel we were told they only had filter coffee which would have been fine but after waiting 10 minute for a cup i then heard the sound of milk being steamed only to turn around and see that theyin fact do have a coffee machine and were making barista style coffee
3,location i have been in touch about the fact that although i had booked from 22 until 26 october 4 night i wa only able to stay three night because my flight wa cancelled at the last moment a i told you before i have stayed at your hotel on a number of visit so i wa hoping for some consideration and clemency the manager rang me about this and just focused on loss of revenue which i found rather disappointing apart from that i think that in general my stay wa not a good a on previous occasion when i arrived the lady at reception anna gave me a form om which the amount wa something like 820 for four night i had the bookingcom form with me and could show her it said 779 she said she would show me her bookingcom form and then noticed it wa indeed 779 incidentally there wa a date of birth on her form that wa not mine either so i think she may have mixed up two guest she could easily just have said i am sorry rather than just oh on one of the following night when i had a shower the bathroom wa flooded and water even went into part of the bedroom near the threshold i quickly called reception someone brought extra towel and i wa the one doing the cleaning and drying i wonder why the water coming from the shower just flowed away very very slowly the next day maintenance saw to it i hope it ha been fixed i did not shower after that one night also wifi seemed to work less well than on previous stay i dont remember having problem with wifi on previous stay during this stay in the morning and late at night my device often said no internet connection perhaps this is a case of installing more access point no idea a i said there were no problem on previous stay so in all i am beginning to have some doubt about your hotel did i just have some bad luck i dont know i do know that in previous stay i left feeling happier and more satisfied
3,положительный отзыв отсутствует we left a pair of expensive sunglass in our room after contacting the hotel immediately after returning home by phone telling them exactly where they were the hotel didnt return our call when they said they would we then contacted by email after a considerable length of time they responded with a email saying they didnt find them if the hotel had gone and looked or when the room wa cleaned they would have found them feeling very let down

5,the location wa good and breakfast wa okay the staff were friendly too the shower wa good actually on arrival we were early to checkin but they were eager to get u to a better room we were shown two different room both of which were occupied so not the best start to the trip the room we ended up in wa right at the front of the hotel with a huge window that let in a draft so not a very warm room it also stank like cigarette on the way to the room so it must have been near a staff entrancebreak area

3,положительный отзыв отсутствует paid for a double and got 2 single bed
5,on request attention wa paid to my husband birthday by mean of a bottle of prosecco in the room friendly staff however the overall coordination especially at breakfast is somewhat lacking the breakfast buffet is quite limited in choice and sandwich yoghurt and spread are not consistently replenished instant coffee at breakfast served in a jug is really outdated especially for a 4 star hotel shower in one of our room had too little pressure and the cabin wa not clean bed okay
0,the staff are cool room are really small and congested there is only one lift in the whole building the cleaning staff enter the room without customer permission there of broken element on the room and it smell really bad

1,location wa fine and he staff were very helpful my partner wa suddenly taken ill on the 2 nd day and we had to leave on the morning of the 3 rd day without staying the 3 rd night despite initially being told that we could get a refund for this unexpected medical issue park grand reservation have refused to do so because i had not given the required 24 hour notice i have spoken to reservation on the phone and they confirmed that they would not giving me a refund for this reason despite the fact that this wa a sudden medical issue while i accept that i had not given the required 24 hour notice i do not think that this is a very friendly attitude given the medical nature of our sudden departure
1,nothing went well the place is a tip cleaning is poor to non existent the passage carpet are filthy the manager giles is a pleasant guy but either ha problem recruiting good staff or is incapable of getting the best out of the existing staff on our first full day there we returned to the hotel at about 15 h 00 exhausted and looking forward to a rest only to find that our room had not been touched in our absence since 8 h 00 notwithstanding the fact that we had engaged the service light before leaving that morning after complaining a cleaner wa sent to the room while we vacated for at least an hour on our return the room had at best been given a cursory once over the bed cover had simply been pulled straight without the linen underneath having been straightened a sweet paper on the bedside table had not been cleared away nether the towel nor the toiletry had been replaced or replenished indeed the wet towel had simply been rolled up and displayed a if they had been replaced a further complaint finally saw the job done properly but at the cost to u of a further hour cooling our heel on our third day this entire procedure wa repeated a if on ground hog day a further meeting with giles wa held during which we were informed that the cleaner had until 16 h 00 each day to attend to the room on other occasion the dining room did not open at the advertised 7 h 00 annoying when you have planned your day sometimes queuing wa required to access the woefully inadequate dining room space for breakfast this no doubt exacerbated by the fact that the hotel also seek to accommodate so called walk in notwithstanding the inconvenience to resident the lift which i suspect is powered by a steam engine so laboured is it functioning wa not once cleaned during our 4 day stay indeed when we used it for the last time yesterday i noted to my dismay that a piece of paper which wa on the floor of the lift on our arrival wa still there undisturbed 4 day later
3,probably location wa best the breakfast wa very poor cold and undercooked reception far too small just full of suitcase we werent able to check in till 3 o clock no apology nothing i wouldnt class a a 4 star hotel if the wa a deluxe twin then i wouldnt like to see standard room we even had to pay 31 quid for the breakfast even though it wa cold and you would have thought due to very late key check in they would have supplied it

3,i liked the bed comfy arrived people shouting at reception for incompetence not answering phone not sorting room elevator not working dark smell of cigarette in hotel took to room by young chap took to room on basement floor corridor filthy sent in photo thing blocking elevator not safe and he took me to my room in kitchen lift and the having squeezed in he said sorry we are on floor supposed to be on no lift but had luggage crazy when i asked at reception if i had a booking for the next two night they said no i asked they check they said no booking in my name but could see my colleague honestly at that point i wa thinking good tried to contact you about this but no joy i would add in the morning once i found the reception it wa much tidier i asked the lady in office who booked it to speak to hotel about horrible experience and to perhaps give u a credit note for another stay but this time on a floor with a good room and near lift i appreciate all this may because of late arrival but there are some basic you expect for 300 per night clean room clean corridor good appearance of hotel and competent service it wa a sham
5,the bed wa very comfortable no window in the room and the skylight wa blocked off because it wa an area pigeon liked to sit on

4,положительный отзыв отсутствует room smelt strongly of cigarette and smoking
5,location and front of house staff excellent disappointed to be 2 floor down rather than up so no window with natural daylight apart from one at the entrance door which wa so high up that it doe not count room smelt musty although it wa very clean so some air freshner or candle would have helped the hotel bar wa also closed around 10 pm which is very early air freshners in the room later opening for the bar
5,location wa excellent for tube station nice pub and handy for shop room facilites were excellent ie teacoffee making microwave fridge tv iron and ironing board hairdryer and bathroom towel and shower gel and shampoo etc evening meal wa very nice the size of the room especially the bed at breakfast the staff were not clearing table to meet the guest who were wanting breakfast we had to wait on both occasion to be seated the first time we were asked to wait in the lobby and we would be called when the table wa cleared they forget u also the hot breakfast food wa cold

5,staff were very nice bed wa comfortable hotel wa quiet at night checkout time of 1200 midday wa helpful and better than the usual 1000 am or 1100 am but everything else wa no better than average booked the hotel because of lot of very positive review on trip advisor but i now doubt their authenticity hotel wa no better than average across the board and it is hard to believe the expressed enthusiasm breakfast buffet hot item were cold shower in room which wa meant to be a wet room type did not drain and flooded the toilet after 2 shower each day in the room when we arrived were a freebie bottle of wine which wa nice and bottled water but it wa mostly down hill from there nothing totally dreadful but generally the hotel decor and furniture is old and in need of a bit of an upgrade and in particular the lift wa dirty and very small
3,the location wa fantastic value for money wa terrible routine fire drill at 130 am evacuated the whole hotel in the middle of the night and then no compensation wa offered
2,the hotel is a very good location we stay here a lot because of this on this occasion the room wa tiny 09 the fridge did not work and i had to unblock the shower myself it wa blocked with the lid of one of the provided shampoo bottle and a used condom on the top wa not impressed at all

1,location wa why i picked this hotel it is close to the tube nothing else wa good the superior double room wa about 9 foot square there wa only just enough room for my suitcase to reach the desk i had to climb over the bed the bathroom wa so small there wa no room for toiletry and had to squeeze past the door to use the toilet
5,location is good close to the metro and on a quiet street breakfast is decent however they tell you to pay if you want a cappuccino instead of normal coffee the hotel in general is dated you can see sign of wear in the elevator and in the room here a hinge missing here a window handle broken here mold in the bathroom here a hole in the curtain probably left by a cigarette the first room had hard and old pillow that need to be replaced cleanliness dont get me started there wa constant noise in our first room 112 at night and for the second night we asked to be moved when i entered the bathroom i saw a distinct shoeprint on the shower floor along with small curly back hair ew the sheet looked like they were washed and ironed but still had dirty stain on them also in our first room the maid put body lotion along with shampoo and shower gel and the second room had conditioner but no lotion are hygiene product given out randomly also housekeeping didnt replenish tea when cleaning there were also soapcleaner stain on metal part of the shower staff we were promised free breakfast for the first night we came to the restaurant and the waiter wasnt informed the day before we stood there like two idiot waiting for them to decide if theyll give u free breakfast finally they did and then wanted to charge u for cappuccino the maid rang the bell at 8 am in the morning we didnt have the do not disturb sign to be fair but i dont think many people are out of their room at this time already never happened to u before in any other hotel staff is also smoking in front of the main entrance to the hotel this doesnt give you a pleasant feeling soundproofing doesnt exist you can still very well hear whats going on in the other room and especially in the corridor

5,the hotel is quite central and close to transport network restaurant etc the breakfast wa very good majority of the staff were quite friendly and provided good service we really appreciated the late check out gave u time to properly sleep in on our last day it wa just the room we received it felt like it wa in a basement so it wa quite dark and there wa no view some of the furniture wa a bit dusty but noticed some change after housekeeping on our first day

4,положительный отзыв отсутствует the first day we arrived the room wa nothing like the picture it wa extremely narrow and with no amenity we requested a change and they took u to a better one but the damage wa already done mood wise
2,положительный отзыв отсутствует a loveless enterprise if i ever saw one it a if a if no one put any thought into it whatsoever and it wa conceived in a quick meeting between an investor and a realtor the entrance look ok but that only way to get to my room wa by first going to the first floor walking a long dark hallway and then taking a smoke filled emergency stairway down to ground level again not connected to the lobby the room wa ok the people were kind which made me sad for them
5,location well situated very close to earl court underground station and therefore perfect to get to the city centre room very thin wall unfortunately drunken and loud room neighbour staff not really friendly and inconsiderate got worse in comparison to our last visit
5,the interior design wa classy the heated floor in the bathroom were an amazing touch the breakfast wa outstanding and the hole atmosphere wa classy amazing and friendly staff the air conditioning unit didnt work in the room the queen size bed wa just two single mattress put together and could do with extra pillow
5,i didnt like the room no 11 a cleaner room from the bed i could see tea stain on the wallpaper
4,good breakfast good location close to earl court tube station room wa far too small for 2 people and quite dark view wa a brick wall also felt damp alot of condensation on window in morning
4,fantastic value for money staff were exceptional sorry but the emergency room green light wa a major problem for a good night sleep
5,the breakfast wa fine we didnt eat there every morning because there wa little variation in the choice the room wa in the first floor there wa quite a bit of street noise especially at night there wa some sortof halfway house across the road policeon the scene more than a few time the window didnt seal properly and had a poor fix it in the upper corner of the window one day we returned to our rom after 3 pm and the room had not been serviced
2,the room wa large this wa a bonus and by far the only thing that i liked scruffy noisy prostitute all night no window electronical tape holding thing together
4,the location is excellent for all the museum and royal attraction if coming from gatwick airport it is very easy hotel to get too when checking in the receptionist i wa dealing with made the check in process overly complicated insisting on making the holding fee and remaining fee a separate charge for each room i booked i have stayed in this hotel mainly time before and this is the first time it ha ever happened like that am unlikely to stay here again a a result
0,nothing dirty
4,breakfast wa poor the front desk staff wasnt very friendly
3,the location quail it of the room wa not up to a 4 star hotel
4,положительный отзыв отсутствует no window in my room
3,the staff were very friendly and professional decent shower excellent location we were stuck in what i can only describe a the naughty corner in room 005 up one floor down a corridor then down a grubby flight of stair and into the farthest corner of the hotel the room wa very small and although there wa a two door wardrobe one of them could only open about 3 inch due to a bedside table the extractor fan in the bathroom wa almost completely ineffective the worst thing however wa the smell of cannabis in the room i can only assume that it wa from people outside the back of the hotel smoking weed they did offer to move u the next morning but a it wa only a base for two night we didnt bother wont book this hotel again there is a premier inn round the corner or an ibis style a few door down and wed have been better off going to either of them 4 star i dont think so
4,the hotel wa close to the tube station staff were friendly and a good breakfast wa provided on arrival there wa confusion about our booking a allegedly they mixed u up with someone of a similar name my tv had no volume and although i reported it when discovered in the afternoon when returning at night it had still not been fixed when i complained it wa then fixed quickly the reception kept getting my room mixed up with my grandson and sent the tv repair team to his room additionally at one point one of the staff used a pas key and entered his room whilst he wa in it and him having autism this worried and disturbed him i did not think the room wa a 4 star deluxe room it wa pretty ordinary to be honest
0,location basement room light not working noisy toilet sound all night fabric in room damaged and scruffy wanted to move room but nothing available
2,changed room after first night reception staff excellent near to tube station first room wa dreadful on lower ground floor stairwell and corridor to the lower floor had peeling wallpaper and grubby carpet the room had a pungent smell of cannabis unable to change room until next day
4,good location breakfast wa okay room wa technically clean upgraded to 003 would have rather been in a smaller room a wa so hard to get to and had to walk through the stairwell that is obviously where people take smoke break outside the fire door room wa kind of care worn bed sofa and chair all really worn noise from people in the street outside our window during the night also when we came back after housekeeping had been could smell weed in a cheaper hotel none of this would have bothered u but it wa our honeymoon and we wanted it to be more special than it felt
4,good area if it cheap it always different people
5,close to earl court station 1 on 3 rd floor one could hear every passerby in the street below not just loud shout but normal conversationsso you can imagine what it might be like when a couple start fighting in the street at 300 am or when vagrant are talking loudly or when car and truck drive past 2 breakfast wa passable but coffee wa not whatever brown liquid wa served did not cut it so i ordered an americano which turned out to be a good a the soluble nescaf in the room and for which wa considered an extra charge 3 not sure who attribute hotel rating but this wa certainly not a 4 star
1,the breakfast noise bed no window
5,the location we had to move from the first room we stayed the week before in a nice room this wkd the way to the room wa dirty domestic staff were smoking and after a strong smell of cigarette smoke there wa a strong smell of weed too we reported this to the receptionist and we were moved to a nicer room and cigarette and weed smoke free

1,положительный отзыв отсутствует upon check in the initial room we were placed into wa not the room size that wa reserved when this wa mentioned to the staff they gave the impression hey were doing a favor to move u to a larger room we were instructed that we should leave our bag in the room and they would move the bag on our behalf my companion inadvertently left an outfit in the closet when she remembered and contacted the front desk the room wa occupied my companion had to followup with the front desk regarding the status of locating the outfit when the front desk finally followedup she wa told the guest occupying indicated there wasnt an outfit in the closet and there wa nothing that could be done the room very smallit really is only large enough for one person there isnt any room in the bathroom the drain sink for the shower is in the middle of the shower the shower mat that wa provided wa filthy had to request a new one in the middle of our final night the toilet started running after it wa flushed and it wouldnt stop meaning it couldnt be used when i called the front desk a staff person came up to the room and could not fix the issue he indicated that they would send someone up when the maintenance staff arrived at 8 am i advised that we were checking out and needed to shower and use the restroom i had to ask if there wa another room that could be used due to broken toilet they returned with key to a room on the 5 th floor and we were on the 1 st floor spoke with a manager upon check out who indicated they would followup with bookingcom who in turn would followup with me i received an email indicated they would provide a credit due to the inconvenience the only good thing i would say is the location it wa only about 5 minute to the underground train station
4,reception staff lovely and helpful on checkin today l especially a lady called anna decent size bed and room really hot day night and the ac didnt work at all in my room made a complaint in person on the night twice and on the phone once issue could not be resolved and manager nowhere to be seen theyd got other room available for the same night online however i wa not offered this a an option so hot and so uncomfortable without ac a standard hotel room requirement especially at 288 per room per night not impressed

2,nothing smelly room with dirty carpet mold in the shower room very small room dated furniture and sagging mattress we were stuck because we had confirmed reservation through bookingcom we also had another confirmed reservation for two room from 912 june but the hotel cancelled our reservation citing issue with charging credit card bookingcom also did not help i used the same credit card to book marriott nearby thru bookingcom so clearly the issue is with hotel which cancel earlier lower priced reservation to get new booking at higher price it a scam which bookingcom must look into

5,good hotel in a great location you have restaurant and the tube station just a walk down the road our shower drain kept getting blocked which wa a nightmare and the emergency alarm wa going off at 630 am in the morning which caused for a lot of panic and made our stay uncomfortable
2,reasonably clean room staff reasonably helpful when checked in wa shown to a room in the basement with no natural light this is supposed to be a four star hotel the corridor to get there wa filthy it wa a fire escape i can only assume it wa an overflow or staff bedroom the room wa changed but should never have been given it in the first place

2,lovely venue cleaner slamming door and shuffling furniture around at 7 am in room around u and talking in the hallway
4,convenient location room wa in the basement with no window werent aware of this upon booking offered no information at check in about facility breakfast time restaurant etc
4,convenient location poor value for money
2,the property is in a good location allowing exploration of kensington chelsea and westminster we were put into a tiny room that wa part of the old building next door the net curtain looked like they had been up a long a the building and the floorboard creaked loudly when someone moved in the next room in the room itself the air conditioning and the fridge did not work and the drain in the bathroom were clogged so they took forever to drain the staff werent rude but they certainly were not welcoming to be honest i wouldve been better booking a travel lodge

5,location breakfast wa good restaurant food excellent some staff seemed confused with general request and slight discrepancy with additional charge eg charged for 4 day breakfast on 3 day stay rectified though without problem
5,location wa very good room wa not ready and following a lengthy delay second room wa not ready either

3,room wa spacious breakfast wa not included even though i had included this in the booking property in need of repair update not a clean a expected slight musty smell
4,the location wa easily accessible for the tube i didnt like the bed it wa very small not a double more a quarter the breakfast wasnt great and didnt look appealing
4,location wa nice it wa nearby the station which had good connection certain staff did not seem intrested in their job which reflected on how they welcome you however please note some were kind the room wa not properly cleaned there were earplug and fake rose petal on the ground a lot of dust and the balcony wa covered in cigarette i had a slightly higher expectation from this hotel but it is okay i hope they will work on this for future customer
1,location and fruit reception it wa impossible to ventilate moldy wall near the window absolute reluctance at the reception we wanted to leave our suitcase there for 1 hour after checkout and it wa not considered at all not even an effort
0,nothing the room i stayed in had a smell of damp the floor wa damp throughout the bed wa very uncomfortable on 2 occasion someone came into my room early hour of the morning to check if everything wa ok i had to tell them yes and leave but entering the room is unacceptable
5,положительный отзыв отсутствует it very dirty
5,location and bed wa comfortable room wasnt clean lot of dust and rubbish wa left in room from previous guest
5,location proximity to tube station piccadilly line direct to heathrow airport then walking distance to hotel on hogarth rd this property is in desperate need of several update and is not a 4 star property there wa full grown mold in the bathroom plus no ventilation and clogged drain cracked ceiling wall that wa patched and very visible to the eye across entire room old old dingy carpet and furniture old and worn bed with dip and bump noisy thin wall and very noisy air conditioner vent loud and noisy maid from the hall way my room phone wa not working in the room took 24 hr to fix the gym is like dungeon with equipment i went back to my room to attempt my workout instead i had to keep going up and downstairs co keycard use old tech and stopped working several time so much much more they try to compensate for this lowly maintained hotel by giving guest goody on arrival nice but dont use the money instead to update this hotel not 4 star at all you will be paying for access to earl court mostly

7,sicuramente ottima la pulizia quotidiana il ricambio della biancheria la dotazione di prodotti da bagno la disponibilit quotidiana di bollitore e microonde con cafft e acqua in camera ferro e tavolo da stiro incluso zona silenziosa anche se perfettamente collegata con tanti negozi e servizi vicini direi pi che buona laccoglienza possibilit di lasciare il bagaglio a deposito il giorno del check out per non portarselo dietro gi dal mattino 1 non mi piaciuto il piano rialzato dove si trovava la nostra stanza praticamente fronte strada con obbligo di tende sempre chiuse per evitare di trovare gli sguardi dei passanti in camera 2 il letto un popiccolo praticamente una piazza e mezzo e non matrimoniale 3 il nostro affaccio era in strada ma attaccata al balconcino della stanza c il luogo di deposito dei rifiuti quindi oltre a non essere propriamente panoramico si sentiva rumore al passaggio del camion dei rifiuti fortunatamente avendo laria condizionata non abbiamo avuto necessit di aprire il balcone altrimenti avremmo aggiunto anche il profumo a parte queste tre cose risolvibili con una stanza ad un piano superioremi sento comunque di consigliarla come struttura 4 la colazione costava circa 13 sterline al giorno a personama noi abbiamo usufruito della fornitura di caff presente in stanza

6,ottima posizione a solo due minuti a piedi dalla metropolitana e collocato in una zona molto tranquilla da migliorare la pulizia della camera risistemare larredamento polvere nelle lampade nelle parti pi nascoste cera dello sporco porta del bagno che ostruisce il passaggio dentro al bagno allarrivo non avevano la possibilit di tenere il nostro bagaglio siamo arrivati alle 1330 ed il check in era alle 1500 e ci hanno suggerito di portarlo ad uno luggage store a pagamento nelle vicinanze da aggiungere qualche scelta di dolci e salato per la colazione introducendo opzioni tipiche del posto cerano solo alcune cose basilari come bacon salsiccia tre piccole scelte di dolce e magari implementare la scelta di bevande calde nel complesso buono ma da migliorare
6,nur die lage wir waren eine gruppe von 12 personen beim checkin konnten wir in einem schon fertig gereinigten zimmer unsere 12 koffer abstellen bi 14 uhr beim checkout gab e eine diskussion mit der dame maria an der rezeption sie meinte e gibt keinen raum wo wir unsere 12 koffer hineinstellen knnen sie hat un auf die kofferboxen in der ubahn station earl court verwiesen die diskussion ging dann mit dem hotelmanager weiter irgendwann durften alle koffer in unser benutztes zimmer gestellt werden warum nicht gleich so ich hatte da hotel fr august wieder gebucht wegen der lage aber nach der diskussion werden wir dort nicht mehr bernachten
7,de locatie nabij metrostation earl court is fantastisch goede bedden mooie geluidsdichte kamers bij aankomst en vertrek werd ons verteld dat onze bagage niet mocht blijven staan van ons werd verwacht dat we ons londentripje slepend met onze koffers zouden doen dit hebben we niet geaccepteerd aangegeven dat het onacceptabel is dat men niet voor een paar uur een koffer kan achterlaten totdat de vlucht gaat

7,personeel wa erg vriendelijk ontbijt wa lekker engels koffie en thee wordt in kannetjes bij je aan tafel geserveerd heel fijn we kwamen aan op een dinsdag en blijkbaar is dat de dag dat alle buurtbewoners hun afval op straat zetten het hotel staat in een superdeluxe wijk dus we vonden al dat afval heel raar gelukkig wa aan het eind van de dag alles opgeruimd blijkbaar werken ze daar niet met container al je komt al toerist bereid je dan voor op het openbaar vervoer wij hadden dat niet voldoende uitgedacht en hebben uiteindelijk veel van de taxi gebruik gemaakt heel luxe en niet al te duur maar bus en metro zijn natuurlijk veel goedkoper de hoponhopoff bus beviel ons erg slecht omdat die niet op vaste tijden rijden en hooguit 1 x per uur langskomen je staat dus vaak lang te wachten op iets waarvan je niet zeker weet of hij komt de oyster kaart is denk ik aan te raden voor gebruik van ov отрицательный отзыв отсутствует

7,ik zou het hotel zeker aanraden zeer goede locatie dicht bij metro en high street aangename buurt met wat pub en restaurant maar straat zelf zeer rustig ideaal om goed te slapen de kamer wa proper alle faciliteiten aanwezig en zeeer comfortabele bedden het ontbijt vond ik voldoende voor 10 pond dag voordien gereserveerd aan de receptie je kan een english breakfast opscheppen maar ook keuze in wat koffiekoeken cereal fruit de algemene staat van het hotel begint achteruit te gaan er is dringend investering nodig om de detail weer in orde te brengen reed nipt voor een 4 ster hotel momenteel zitbank los in ontbijtzaal afbladerende verf zetel in de kamer begint stuk te gaan het hotel is proper maar heeft opnieuw extra verzorging nodig housekeeping indien je dit wil moet je lampje laten branden ik vind dat niet de standaard aanpak in een 4 ster hotel dit kan best vermeld worden bij checkin
6,personalet var enormt imdekommende og hjlpsomt vi havde badekar fantastisk og dejligt at bo hjt oppe p 5 sal morgenmaden var tilpas og helt fin med meget gode plser og restauranten har en god afternoon tea i bde engelsk og indisk variant beliggenheden var i top ganske nr earl court tube station og mange restauranter pubber og butikker og med buslinjer mod centrum rundt om hjrnet og ikke s langt fra hyde park vi kommer helt sikkert gerne igen vores hotelvrelse var ret koldt vinduet kunne ikke lukke helt i s den der l nrmest vinduet fr hele natten og det var lidt svrt at regulere air conditionen desuden var sengen lidt for smal for to velvoksne skandinaver og det ville vre dejligt hvis man p forhnd fik hver sin dyne i stedet for en deledyne tvsignalet var drligt og flimrende p de fleste af kanalerne og wifien fungerede heller ikke s godt vi undrede o i vrigt lidt over at hotellet har 4 stjerner for sine steder var det noget nedslidt havde det ligget i skandinavien ville det formentlig hjst f 3 stjerner

2,o hotel prximo do metr e a localizao como um todo muito boa com todo tipo de restaurante perto e bastante segura o hotel muito limpo e todo novinho alm disso o funcionrios so bastante prestativos e educados chegamos no hotel 1 hora da manh no colocaram em um quarto que no tinham energia somente a luzes funcionavam tomadas frigobar secador e microondas no funcionavam no tnhamos nem como carregar o celular no trocaram de quarto e incrivelmente o quarto novo tambm no tinha energia ningum checou ante de no trocar de quarto reclamamos e tentaram no convencer a esperar at 8 horas da manh para no colocarem em um novo quarto poi no tinham disponvel depois de desistirmos exaustos e com fome mudaram de ideia e no trocaram de quarto novamente o novo quarto era frio tinha uma janela que entrava ar frio e no tinha jeito de resolver mesmo com o aquecedor no mximo o quarto ainda continuava frio a cama tambm parecia ser menor que uma cama de casal at a coberta era pequena eu e minha esposa acabamos desistindo de reclamar j era 4 horas da manh quando fomos colocados em um novo quarto e se no fosse a ajuda de um o funcionrio do hotel teramos ficado com fome acho que ele ficou com pena da nossa situao e no ajudou a pedir uma pizza em resumo acabamos perdendo toda a manh do dia poi s conseguimos dormir quando j era mais de 5 horas da manh nossa viagem era curta e perdemos nosso planejamento do primeiro dia tambm no gostei do caf da manh ma isso foi uma peculiaridade minha era uma caf da manh com poucas opes e destinado principalmente a britnicos tpico feijo adocicado com ovo bacon e linguia acredito que poderiam considerar que muitos turistas no comeriam o que estava sendo oferecido a partir do segundo dia decidimos comprar nosso prprio caf embora j havamos pago pelo caf no 3 dia acredito que nossa experincia tenha sido totalmente frustada pelo problema quando chegamos e espero que tenhamos sido excesso

0,posizione e pulizia camera mi dispiace dare questa brutta recensione se vedete i miei precedenti giudizi non ne ho mai fatti di co severi ma quello che successo non mi era mai capitato in tanti anni di viaggio sia allarrivo che alla partenza la reception non ci ha tenuto i bagagli dicendo che fosse una decisione del manager dellhotel che stata presa pochi giorni prima del nostro arrivo 810 dicembre per chi come noi arriva la mattina presto noi alle 900 e riparte verso laeroporto in serata 1700 un mancato servizio che pu anche rovinare una vacanza soprattutto in una citt enorme come londra per nostra fortuna un hotel della stessa strada ci ha tenuto le valigie gratis e ce la siamo cavata ma non ci si comporta assolutamente co il tutto accompagnato da risatine dello staff alla reception
3,nhe zur ubahn ist extrem angenehm e gibt keine mglichkeit die koffer dort zu lassen habe ich bi jetzt noch in keinem hotel erlebt und macht e natrlich sehr mhsam wenn man etwas frher al checkin ankommt fr den preis erwarte ich mir diesen service mein zimmer war im keller ohne die mglichkeit ein fenster zu ffnen wenig einladen und dadurch auch kaum empfang wlan mangelhaft personal vereinzelt nett aber der groteil eher unfreundlich bzw wenig interessiert

4,lo staff gentile e disponibile la colazione in buona sostanza una truffa se seleziono colazione incluse e decido di pagare una tariffa maggiorata il motivo evitare di dover stare a contrattare la mattina appena sveglio invece in questo albergo con nostra grande sorpresa la colazione pagata non include un drink caldo se non un caff nero orribile e gi freddo o un t francamente imbarazzante che si possa pensare di chiedere un extra per le bevande calde a colazione inoltre non era scritto da nessuna parte su booking e per quanto ci riguarda dora in po ci fideremo ancora meno della piattaforma online di booking

7,great location bathroom a bit small for larger people
6,location to paddington station is great plus surrounded by place to eat one night before flight heathrow from paddington is a breeze the staff were super friendly and wanted to know about the stay i would stay here again a little tired and noise from floor above but that can be in any hotel think bb any seafront no lift
7,cosy hotel with nice staff very good location near paddington trainstation clean room with own bathroom very small toilet no breakfast it a bit outdated
5,the location is great only one plug socket for two lady getting ready kettle had to be boiled underneath a dressing table on the floor had to unplug the telly to charge a phone

6,close to paddington great staff very comfortable bad room wa tiny but price wa good

7,property is in a great area price is just right shower size not much they can change about it though so i understand
6,proximity to paddington wa the only reason i chose it it wa quiet secure clean and the reception staff lovely tea etc in room old bathroom need updating the shower wa feeble and i had to pay extra for one with an en suite loo which is unusual in this day and age
7,the helpful and friendly staff the facility and the central hotel location the en suite bed linen and wc wa clean and fresh the room had good lighting ventilation and heating control for comfort a compact but cosy room for one maybe include a full length mirror a the dresser one wa too low
7,great location shower wa bit small

7,the location of this hotel is perfect for short stay in london or connecting with the rail or an airport near paddington station mere metersyards away from the tube and the bus station in the area at walking distance from hyde park please note a most small hotel in this area this is a very basic establishment room is really small the bathroom even smaller but unlike other place in the vicinity where i have stayed this is a rather clean establishment with very helpful staff the reception close at 8 pm but you can still reach the guy in case of a problem very easily no breakfast availble but it is perfectly ok if you buy some food from the nearby restaurant some of them are really good and bring it in the hotel to eat it in it breakfast room nothing reallly but still pleae be aware the room are really really small nothing can be done about it with these hotel in old victorianedwardian house in this particular area the shower cubicle might be rather tense for bigger person oh we had some noisy bathrooom ventilator in our room it is connected to the bathroom light switch but stop vrooming whole 20 minute after you kill the light

9,i loved the location the staff wa wonderful very lovely one suggestion though have complementary coffee or tea at the lobby it really not feasiable to be making it in the room a the coffee itself is not that good the one in the room thank you there are two thing wall are kind of thin so you have to either turn on the fan or play some white noise at night or youll be hearing all the walk around if your room is by the stair but it not the worst a far a issue i still had a pleasant stay

8,perfect location if you get off from paddington literally around the corner we found it quiet with lot of restaurant nearby serving great food all the staff were helpful and kind and happy lot of stair unless you are on the ground floor if you have heavy luggage it a bit of a mission to lug it all the way up like we did but it wa manageable
9,great central location ideal for exploring the city london price
8,great location 5 min to subway 10 min to airport bus silent place in a park great food option nearby close to all london attraction dining room and terrace very small sink almost unusable noise from room above walking etc probably due to wooden construction unusable fridge near reception not freezing

8,location wa excellent super close to paddington station which wa great a we had a 630 am train to catch and were able to walk there in just a few minute the room wa larger than we expected decent shower pressure too the lady on reception who greeted u wa really friendly and welcoming we were overall very happy with our stay although if we had to critique one thing it would be that the bed wa really too soft but this is just our personal preference everything else that wa great about it outweighs this small criticism
8,this is a good value assuming you dont intend to spend a lot of time in your room my singleperson room wa tiny there is barely room to walk around the bed if you are a big person you will feel cramped however all the necessity are there a toilet a sink a tiny shower a twin bed small ceilingmount tvand wifi you cant beat the location just a few minute walk from paddington station which mean easy access to food shop and tubetrain staff wa professional and pleasant a long a you understand what you are getting into i think this is a good value for the price paid and i would stay here again a advertised there is no elevator you must be willing to drag your luggage up several flight of stair depending on the room you get if you have accessibility issue then dont stay here housekeeping is not daily
8,location friendliness clean room wa perfect for one night
8,amazing price for location super friendly and helpful front desk staff ease of access to paddington station and heathrow okay the shower is small and low pressure but it isnt a bad a some other review make it out to be it a cheap and cheerful little place thats good for what you pay

3,nice staff helping with information about surroundings where to eat or have a drink doing their best to improve your accommodation comfortable bed close to underground station train bus dirty smelly room not enough ventilation very small toilet separated from the bathroom no ventilation if you are claustrophobic or over 100 kg please do not try dirty table sticky and dusty not enough towel please bring your own same toiletry no soap in the bathroom pillow case inside out which made u wander if they were changed wifi available but very weak signal almost none cleaning need a lot of improving
4,location location location bed wa on the small side in hall wc wa a pain
4,staff wa friendly room wa extremely small and cramped
4,unbeatable excellent location walking distance from paddington station a short walk only take a few minute a ton of restaurant and bar to choose from gift shop and everything tiny room and bathroom probably the smallest bathroom ive ever seen in my life it wa difficult to to shower no room service but they would change towel if you asked for it
4,the staff were so friendly and helpful the location to paddington station and restaurant wa great the hotel is very run down uneven floor board extremely small room on 3 rd floor with very narrow steep stair it would be so hot in the summer
4,location is excellent if you have an early train from paddington clean and quiet though shower good top room is truly the garret in the hotel 77 step need to edge around the bed
0,location wa good room wasnt very good in basement no air

4,location room too small looked like a childrens room maybe due to twin bed double room much larger
8,perfectly located very friendly and helpful staff my room wa tiny but thats not unusual in london
3,good location to lord stadium for walking to the cricket tiny room in what seemed like the basement of the property when we booked 5 month prior so i would of expected a better room very stuffy with no air flow yucky smell when the bathroom fan came on and a tiny shower also breakfast wa meant to be included but apparently they no longer do breakfast bed were quite sunken and had a sore back afterwards
4,the location of this hotel is really the only thing it ha going for it very convenient to paddington station nearby restaurant and pub despite having no bedside table it did have a good night light on the wall the window opened fpr fresh air which wa nice my room wa up 4 flight of stair a part of which becomes incredibly narrow and steep there wa no elevator nor any offer of assistance with my luggage i am 65 year old and luckily traveling somewhat lightly on my ten day visit to the uk but this hotel presented a real challenge in this regard the room itself wa very small no bedside table no extra blanket or pillow there wa one electrical outlet there were no drinking glass no bottled water only 2 coffee cup an electric kettle and teacoffee packet the bathroom had a very small sink no toiletry not hand towel or face cloth no soap at the sink and no shelf for toothbrush or other necessity no hook in toilet closet the toilet wa fine but no toilet paper roll holder toilet paper sat on the back of the toilet the shower had dispenser with body wash and shampoo no conditioner this wa a minimalist place to stay the worst part wa the climb up and down the stair and concern about what might happen if a fire broke out in the night there wa one very narrow way in and one very narrow way out i didnt take photo probably because i wa so traumatized having to navigate the staircase with my bag
3,location the room
8,clean отрицательный отзыв отсутствует
4,no breakfast wa available they had stopped serving breakfast since covid the bed wa only 46 wide the floor in the room sloped the room we were given did not seem like the one on the website

3,location no lift extremely small room for 3 people bathroom on airplane wa bigger
2,положительный отзыв отсутствует single room on 3 rd floor no lift room wa so tiny it wa hard to find anywhere to put my case down
0,nothing everything about this hotel is bad
3,the staff wa every understanding and helpful they were lovely and accommodating the room had all the facility advertised wifi shower toilet kettle with tea and coffee despite the staff help i cannot say that this wa worth the money and i ended up booking elsewhere after the first night i did not expect anything fancy but the single room wa very very small a box room with practically no space around the single bed and low ceiling which felt claustrophobic this may be what room are like in that area but i did not expect that
4,location wa good near station lamp wa taped up with duck tape making it a fire hazard not enough plug had to unplugg tv to turn fan on and bed were very old and low
1,положительный отзыв отсутствует room and bathroom extremely small no bedsheets change for the overall stay
1,location wa excellent the front desk staff wa friendly the room had no space at all we couldnt fit in the room with the toilet without our knee touching the door and there wa no bathroom fan the drinking glass had caked on grime in the bottom there were only sheer curtain on the window so you couldnt make the room dark to sleep the room smelled of mold and mildew the front staff wa pleasant and tried to please but there wa no point telling them these issue a they couldnt fix them anyway except the cup
3,the location is convenient and staff were lovely the room had the basic facility like kettle hair dryer fan the single room wa tiny at 2 m by 2 m square including the toilet and shower i couldnt even shut the toilet door when using the toilet because my leg didnt fit in the toilet stall the shower wa near impossible to use because it wa so small it felt more like a ship cabin rather than a hotel room there wa a gap under my door so i could hear everything outside the room
3,very central location near to paddington station decent nofrills budget hotel but very noisy the wall must be paper thin i wa able to hear lot of noise from the other guest and the sound of the guest in the room above me walking around wa enough to keep me awake no fault of theirs just no sound proofing at all
2,the staff wa nice and friendly there wa a fan provided in the room the location is great close to paddington station there is a park and many shop around while location is great the hotel itself is very underwhelming the room is really cramped the bathroom is the smallest ive ever seen i cant even tpose in it the floor wa uneven and dipped down towards the middle of the room like a valley
2,location wa good about everything else except for the lady at the reception who wa really friendly and helpful
3,the hotel is not recommendable however the location is very good 1015 min walking distance to hyde park and some cool barsrestaurants in the area overall can not recommend the hotel mainly based on the following factor i cleanliness towel and sheet in the bedroom were dirty ii room it wa unbearably warm in the room when it wa 2224 degree celsius outside in the morning it felt like 30 degree in the room there wa no air conditioning and the fan wa of limited use iii service the staff wa anything but helpful when we asked if they could call u a taxi they told u to do it ourselves there wa no breakfast due to covid measure although no one had to wear a mask
3,location the hospitality from the management and the bedroom on 4 th floor a i had a child and going up them stair wasnt the best experience also the bed wasnt comfortable a it wa out dated and the room wa really small for a family of 3 also i had to pay extra payment just to change room to the ground floor and wa rushed out the room on my departure day from the hotel
4,location is excellent bed not comfortable it the best place to stay at but wa a good option for the price we paid
4,the location is great very central and the staff wa very friendly the room sold a a room for three people wa tiny we were hardly able to move the bed were not very comfortable and we did not get much sleep a it wa very loud in the hotel due to the very thin wall old pipe other guest
3,location of the hotel size of washroom is not at all feasible for family
4,close to the metro station no air con fan not working room exposed to the sun so boiling hot
