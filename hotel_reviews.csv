Breakfast ok.","I ordered a double bed and had paid for the previous day as we were arriving off a 13 hours flight first thing in the morning. Staff spent a long time discussing things when we arrived and we were shown to a room with twin beds that had just been pushed together. Clearly our room from the day before had not been allocated.

There are only two electrical sockets in the room and one USB charge point. This is not enough. The light switch system is confusing, with some switches doing nothing! 
Breakfast is very limited for vegans and vegetarians. I’m vegetarian and the only thing I could have was cereal and bread based products. I don’t eat eggs so the cooked breakfast available to me would have been baked beans, tomato and hash browns.

9,Very pleasant staff and comfortable room with basic coffee tea etc. Very clean.,Receptionists were.good but didn't offer any drinks etc while we waited for our room or suggestions of places to visit I think they assumed we'd been before and knew the area so would have been better if they were more.proactive.

7,"The staff was friendly and accommodating, and the cleanliness of the room, including the bedsheets, was commendable. However, there were a couple of issues that affected my stay.

Firstly, I noticed that the air in the hotel felt moldy, possibly due to rogue walls hidden behind the wallpaper. This was a concern for me, as I value clean and fresh air quality. It would be advisable for the hotel management to address this issue and ensure that the air circulation in the rooms and hallways is improved.

Secondly, the room was quite noisy. I could hear the sound of water running loudly from the drain, which was a bit disruptive. Additionally, the walls seemed to lack sufficient soundproofing, as I could hear noises from neighboring rooms, such as sneezing or doors being opened. This affected my sleep.
 I must say that the bed was comfortable, and the room was clean. The friendly and helpful attitude of the hotel staff was also a positive aspect of my experience.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.

Crockery was not replenished I had to ask for plates and cutlery. I had to ask for milk for my coffee as this was not provided when the coffee brought in a teapot ? was brought to my table.

Was well appointed. Good breakfast.",Only issue was we needed to cancel two days before due to rail engineer works and tube strikes so we had to cancel Sunday plans and they declined to accommodate I would have been happy to take a credit and rebook.

We had luggage to check in as we were heading off to see a matinee theatre performance but a sign on the desk advised that there were no storage facilities. I can imagine that this is as frustrating for the staff as much as the residents and would expect management to come up with a solution, quickly. There must be a spare room that can be allocated as a luggage store on site? This could put potential customers off."

8,Lovely quiet Street close to everything we wanted. Our room was excellent.. (Room 101) Very clean with comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. The breakfast was very good . The staff were friendly. We booked this Hotel last January as we were going to The Albert Hall.

7,Room was fantastic - housekeeping was excellent. Breakfast was OK - pretty basic after our other hotel on our London hotel stay before our cruise.,Front office staff - some were OK & others almost rude & just ignore me when I approached the desk or fobbed me off qwith some irrelevant repsonse. All restaurant staff were rude & unpleasant which is why we didn't eat there. Was looking forward to eating in the restaurant & after 1 morning at breakfast was enough to go somewhere else. I have never been asked to leave the breakfast room 10 mins after the breakfast finish time - rude! I was brought tea when I wasn't even asked & I said I would prefer coffee - just grunted & walked away & 15 mins later still waiting!

8,"Brilliant location, close to Tube and lots of pubs, cafes and restaurants.
Staff very helpful when air con initially didn’t work.",Our room was on the ground floor with only a tiny window straight out onto the footpath in front of the hotel so lacked privacy. We didn’t spend much time there so didn’t matter too much but meant we had to keep the air con going.

Less than 5 minutes walk from the nearest underground station.",This really isn't a moan but if I have to say something it would be the view from the bedroom window.

8,"Liked almost everything. Clean in every way, comfortable room with microwave as well as a fridge and decent tv, pleasant staff, excellent location for our stay in London. Very close to Earls Court underground station, and good food outlets, M&S, Leon, Pret A Manger, Cafe Nero, the Blackbird pub, McDonalds and within reach of smarter dining locations by short taxi journeys.","The only grudge in a near perfect hotel was that we didn’t book breakfast daily originally, but decided to take breakfast on our last morning, booked in at reception for the meal at 6pm the previous evening, and the booking was accepted. 
We arrived in the dining room the next morning to be told that we couldn’t eat because breakfast was not part of our booking. We explained that a booking had been accepted the previous evening, but this wasn’t believed. I said ‘Would you rather we lefty?’ ‘Yes’ came the reply from the restaurant manager. 
We then rang down from our room to reception to explain our embarrassment, and ask if the booking had in fact been made. No answer to that question, ‘But come down now, you will be served!’ We went down but again we were refused. I got cross then and said ‘Fine, but this will be part of our review of your hotel’. Suddenly a table was found, and we were invited to choose our breakfast from a very reduced supply. Such a shame that we were treated without curtesy, willing of course to pay extra, on our last morning. We were charged full price for a less than warm breakfast which included a lot of stress for starters."
8,Location was perfect. Less than a 8 minute walk to Earl’s Court Station. The staff were welcoming and very helpful with our luggage.,Better disabled accessibility to the toilets near reception.
8,Very clean and friendly,As we were travelling for our 30th anniversary we wanted breakfast in our room on that morning. When we asked at reception the lady was unclear and just suggested we called down in the morning. This would have been better if we had been offered a menu to order from as it left it all very vague. We didn’t want to cause an issue so went down for breakfast as usual.

8,"Perfect location as a central travelling starting point with Earl’sCourt tube minutes walk away. Plenty of attentive, courteous and helpful staff on hand. Excellent (and tasty) breakfast choices again with super staff.","Beyond hotel’s control, but some local building work started at 8am. Minor detail in overall experience."
9,"Superb location, 3 minute walk to Earls Court Underground.
All staff very polite, engaging and efficient.

On a quiet side street but just a short walk to Tube. Good Indian restaurant on site.

Lovely fluffy white towels and a proper wrap around bath sheet not a skimpy towel.",Given an upgrade at check in but realised this would be in a basement room with no windows so declined and reverted to room booked - which wasn't a problem.

Clean, very friendly staff…was quite expensive but I guess you get what you pay for…would definitely stay there again!",Our room was right next to the big door that separated the corridor so although the hotel is well sound proofed every time someone went through the door it made a loud bang not ideal at 1am….a slow close door would have been better.
9,"The location, friendly staff and a comfortable room.",The decor in the room could do with a refresh.
7,"This was a last minute booking as we decided to stay in London after a day out. Hotel was easy to find and a room was ready around 40 minutes after I booked online. The hotel was beautifully clean, our room was a good size for 2 of us with a lovely little box of chocolates on arrival, we were shown to our room. Staff were polite and very helpful.","Although there was a bottle a water each in our room the mini bar was not stocked. As it was a last minute booking we had no toiletries with us and there was no shower gel in the shower only shampoo. The breakfast was average, very little selection when comparing to other hotels and although breakfast was included in the price I ordered a lattè which I had to pay extra for, considering the price of the room I found the breakfast was not to a standard I would expect."
8,"Convenient 5 minute walk from Earls Court tube station. Good choice of restaurants/pubs in the area. Clean comfortable hotel within walking distance of Kensington Gardens, Natural History Museum and Victoria and Albert museum.","Whilst the wifi was free and fast, it was not password protected, and the way it was configured prevented you from establishing a VPN for secure communications.

I wouldn’t have expectations but the price was not small at all."

The breakfast is one of the best we have had anywhere. Perfect sausages, bacon etc with a good choice of bread, pastries.","I didn't like being charged for an extra 4 breakfasts when the booking specified breakfast included. I booked 2 rooms, each for 2 people for 2 nights. Very disappointed. It cost an additional 60.00. Why would only one person in each room require breakfast?? Very bizarre."

8,"Anna, on reception, greeted us on arrival.She was very friendly and smiley. She gave us clear information about the hotel and our room. 
The restaurant staff were also very polite and friendly. The food was very good too.","The hotel had messaged me to advise parking at the nearby Marriott hotel. This is not good advice. This car park only has 8 spaces. They are filled by local workers. ( The staff at the Marriott Hotel were very helpful. It is not their carpark )

All nicely boutique with various sockets for plugs, devices etc. 
Great location near to Underground and restaurants/pubs and M&S food store for all eating requirements. It seemed almost perfect, and almost was.","Only drawback was with breakfast. At first it seemed pretty good, although limited options compared to many other similar establishments. Cooked limited but tasty enough. Staying 4 nights I wanted a little variety, like an omelette or poached eggs on toast. 'Scrambled' was the default egg offering. Noone mentioned an option. There was however, you had to know to notice the chef, ask him and stand and wait for two poached eggs, meanwhile toasting your own bread and awaiting the eggs. My only fortee into other egg options was a big disappointment, as both poached eggs were party raw egg white inside.

We were 2 couples and actually got 2 different Types of room (a bigger and a smaller one) so we got an upgrade for the smaller room, what we appriciated very much. 

The next tube Station was very close to the Hotel so we had a very good connection for all sightseeing activities. Some places like the kensington palace you can even reech by a short walk. 


I can only recommend this hotel.",The shower could be cleaner but the rest of the Bathroom was fine. I would really recommend to add a Toilet brush to the bath Equipment that would be better for everyone involved.

7,the hotel location is excellent. room was clean and comfortable. price for breakfast needs to be adjusted to suit someone who doesn't want a full English breakfast.

9,"Me and my partner stayed at the Park Grand hotel just for the night to explore London. We booked it 2 days prior so that may have affected the price however we got it for an incredible value! The staff were incredibly friendly for the short duration we were there. Now, getting down to the room itself because that's the whole reason for this review. The room was AMAZING! I would've preferably liked it a little bigger however, it was a decent size. It was clean, the shower was my favourite part, it was a shower head attached to the ceiling like a wet room and it was just perfect! The tv was a good size and was good volume wise too. The view was lovely, and we were on the 4th floor. One of my favourite features was the features for do not disturb, the doorbell and a maid. These were buttons by the door you could press. We also had a mini fridge too which was perfect! one more thing.... THE PICTURES DONT DO THIS PLACE JUSTICE so don't judge the photos! The room was beautiful I didn't manage to capture any pictures only a video of it however, it exceeded my expectations massively! I can't give it a 10 because nothing is perfect however this was AMAZING","The only thing that was the tiniest bit annoying was the lift noise, it was a tad squeeky and was a little bit small."

8,Have stayed previously in the basement rooms and phone signal was shocking I kept having to go outside to use my phone. This time I stayed on the upper floors and phone signal was great. Room was very small even thou of paid for a larger room but I guess this was due to asking for a room on the higher floors. Location is fantastic there's a shop for anything you need and a minutes walk to earls court tube station.,Breakfast is very overpriced at £15. There's a cafe at the end of the road where you can get a full breakfast for £10.

9,"This was our second time staying at the Park Grand and we liked it as much the second time. The location is excellent - 1 block to Earl’s Court Underground Station and within walking distance of the Natural History and V&A Museums. The rooms are a decent size, everything in the bathroom works and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel is excellent value.",The wifi could be a bit better- but that is a minor quibble.

8,"Lovely staff who were very welcoming. Close to the tube and amenities.
Free room upgrade which was an added bonus. Bathroom looked recently refurbed.","Some areas of the property were a little tired (carpets, tiles) but this didn’t spoil the stay.
Lighting in the room wasn’t great (quite dark, flickering bulbs - where non-dimmer bulbs were used on a dimmer)"
8,very clean,only criticism is only one bath size towel for a couple but I’m sure another one would have been provided if we had asked
8,"Location great.
Breakfast 10/10, nice to get hot & tasty food. Breakfast staff were exceptionally friendly & helpful.
Hotel clean, tidy & comfortable","Tea/coffee/milk not stocked up in room, had to phone for more & it didn't arrive! We needed a drink before going out to the theatre. Chased it up & was told NO milk?? would have been nice to have been kept updated & we could have popped out for some ourselves. They finally brought some in a jug as we were leaving our room to go out!
 Only 1 bath towel, had to ask for another even though a double room.
Coffee/water flasks in reception cold (on 2 occasions) & although we nicely mentioned it to a member of staff standing next to it nothing was done, & it was not replenished, but ignored!"

7,"great location, staff were very helpful and nice. room was a great size",the window in our room was broken which meant it was always slightly open and you could hear people or cars outside passing by. the microwave was very outdated and was defiantly on its way out.

8,Great location... So close to earls Court tube,Can't fault it
9,"very clean, lovely staff, comfy beds!",some maintenance noise
8,"I got the Deluxe Double.

Room facilities - There was a microwave, fridge, iron + ironing board, full tea/coffee amenities, light switches with individual controls, large 'modern' TV, hairdryer, safety box/locker, many large mirrors and great air conditioning/heating

IT facilities - There was a whole panel of ports (i.e. HDMI, USB) to connect to the TV and many sockets (at least 4?)

Bathroom - I loved the shower! There were 2 shower options, a regular shower head and another that is attached to the ceiling right above you. Water pressure + heating was excellent. Bathroom amenities provided - soap, shampoo, conditioner, extra toilet rolls, lotion.

Room service - food was reasonably priced and fairly cheap for a hotel and halal options available. 

Location - literally just about a minute walk to tube station (Earl's Court) with many grocery stores/ restaurants nearby.","Customer care - I waited at the reception to check in for quite a while. They were busy to begin with which I understood. But when they served another customer before me who just arrived, I was a little annoyed. Also, the receptionist dealing with my check in was sneezing/coughing multiple times into their bare hands which I was uncomfortable with as they were handling my debit card and room key card. At least they apologised but I would have preferred if they washed their hands rather than just squirt a tiny bit of sanitiser.

The bed - the double bed was huge, but it was two single beds put together so I couldn't sleep in the middle. Plus, both mattresses had different ""firmness"" with one more firm and the other that sunk in. 

Old(ish) furniture/ carpet - Furniture looks a bit run down and the chair in the room at the desk sunk in and was uncomfortable (but it's not terrible). Carpet was also not very clean with some stains (but I turned a blind eye to this)

Lift - it was so much slower than most lifts, even at cheaper hotels (I could walk up the stairs to the 4th floor faster than the lift) BUT having a lift is better than no lift so it's not the worst. There was only one lift though."
8,"The hotel was in an excellent location and it was nice, clean, and comfortable.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
9,"Very nice staff, clean rooms, comfy bed, modern bathroom","The amenities are a bit old, especially since the ventilation in the bathroom is non existent, some amenities were rusty"
9,deluxe double was great. big and tidy. good facilities in the room.,TV had no signal and the shower had a blocked drain.
9,The staff were great and friendly very helpful,"The only fault that I found was at breakfast the beans were not very hot, and that's all probably just an oversight.
And I was not going to complain about something so trivial because they really looked after us
Been twice before so you don't go back if you don't like it, we felt very comfortable
Regards to the team back there
Regards Paul and Angela"
9,All of the staff were both friendly and efficient. The room was serviced and the bed linen changed every day. The restaurant was of a good standard and not over priced.

Breakfast very good - lots of choice but only scrambled eggs - prefer fried, poached etc.
Staff very helpful.","The most odd thing was that our room was not cleaned during our stay, until we specifically requested it. I have stayed in many, many hotels in Europe, UK, America, Canada, and this is the only hotel I have come across where the room is cleaned only if you ask for it to be done. We were told we had to press a ""Clean room"" button in our room. This is OK if rather odd, but no one told us we had to this. It was not mentioned in the instructions in the room either."
9,"Fabulous friendly hotel, very clean, great location just 4 min walk from the tube station",Nothing
9,The staff were excellent and looked after us so well for a special occasion. The room was perfect for us and very clean.,"There are parts of the hotel that could use a little TLC to bring it back up to a premium boutique hotel, however it certainly would not put me off staying there again."

The hotel was spotless and the towels were changed every day. 
 I had advised the hotel that we were coming down for my boyfriends special birthday and they made the room so special with balloons, rose petals all over the bed and complimentary truffles and other special touches.
The hotel is in a great location and minutes away from coffee shops, bars and the subway. I really would recommend this hotel.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.

seems to me that I should of paid the additional night not the total stay as money was already removed from my card"
8,Super location beside the tube for getting around. Lovely staff and comfortable bed.,The rooms are probably overpriced. We had a superior room and it was tiny. The pictures on the site don't show how small it is. Probably prices are due to the area the hotel is in....Kennington.

8,"Staff were really helpful & friendly. Happy for us to leave our luggage on arrival & departure days. Stayed during heatwave & were given bottled water when we arrived back after a hot day in the city. Room had everything you would need. Perfect location for visiting the city, just minutes from station.","Nothing to dislike. Not a dislike but we stayed 4 nights & they changed the sheets for the 4th night which seemed a waste, maybe 3rd night would have been better or not at all for this short stay."
9,"Didn’t realise I’d booked a Boutique hotel till arrival. Was pleasantly surprised at the size of room, not huge but not pokey. The aircon was a total necessity during the heatwave. The staff were super helpful and friendly. I messed up the aircon -the fixed it. We ran out of milk- they provided it. Always with a smile and good grace.","The safe was almost floor level, beside the bed. It’s been a long time since my husband’s been on his knees before me 🤭."

Also, the room was very quiet despite being in central London and the air con worked very well during a spell of hot weather.

8,location and the staff were lovely made you feel very welcome nice touch too for my birthday in our room,I would always book a bit bigger room and on the front of the property next time
8,most staff efficient and nice. good breakfast. very clean.,when we asked to book a cab we were grossly overcharged by the driver. he was not honest and the hotel should not use the company they called. that was disappointing and we told them but they did not seem to care. we will only use the cabbie with those black cars. they were polite and had a meter and very nice to talk to
9,location amd staff,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
9,Very helpful and friendly staff. Special thanks to Rohan at the front desk for his kindness.,"Excellent stay, great location, nice staff. Only suggested improvement would be cotton sheets. The current ones feel scratchy & cheap."
9,The tall young man who checked us in was very attentive and helpful,I requested a quiet room in a higher floor however we were given a room in the basement with no direct elevator access. The phone in the room did not work so we had to drag and carry our luggage to the ground floor
9,"I liked the room and air conditioning. Wasnt a big room but it had everything i needed. Also the staff was very helpful and attentive. This actually blew me away because i really wasnt expecting it. Was really nice to see, they all helped me with any concerns and needs I had and showed a genuine interest in doing so. Keep up the great work!",A little noisy near my room and also there were some building noises but nothing major. I think it just needs some updating.
7,The staff were fabulous in the reception area. The room was a deluxe double and we were put at the back of beyond in the basement with no window. Bit disappointing. There was no soundproofing as stated. You could hear everything from other rooms tv to everydoor opening and shutting. We only spent time in the room from 9.30 pm and 9am,The room was a bit dingy but clean
8,"facilities were good and staff were very friendly, even decorated our room for our anniversary celebration","we opted for a double deluxe room, we discovered when going to bed that it was two single beds pushed together with a cloth covering over to hide the gap but once laying down you can feel the dip. this was rather uncomfortable but it was too late in the night to ask for another room and didn’t want to waste the night trying to sort it. was the only let down."
9,"Nice place, nice staff, we had a big bath and super shower, hearty full English or continental breakfast with attentive service when called on.",Would have preferred above ground room but not really a problem.
8,Helpful staff,Small bath towels
8,The hotel itself is lovely. It's a great location. Very close to Earl's Court tube and loads of shops and restaurants close by,The reception staff were not a bit welcoming or even helpful. I found them abrupt and dismissive
9,Very good and very convenient,The same hotel in n. Ireland
9,I didn’t eat there.,Room space is too small.
9,central location,a bit small (but central London maybe OK?!)
7,Lovely hotel which has been newly decorated. Staff very helpful. Room service great. Meals good.,We booked a superior room and a deluxe double room. My husband and I were checked into the smaller room with a queen sized bed whilst my adult son was checked into the larger room with a king size bed! More attention to detail on behalf of the hotel staff would have prevented this from happening.
9,Nice and modern,Clean
8,The staff. They were all very helpful and professional. Always happy to help with any organisation of taxis and good knowledge of the area. Breakfast was good with variety of cooked food and fresh fruit.,The lower room at the hotel hut the staff were very helpful and we were given another room

Free bottles of water provided every day which was definitely needed in the heatwave. Shower water pressure was great. Air conditioning worked well, again very necessary for the heatwave during our visit!","The hot water was turned off one night without any warning which was frustrating. Elevator was very slow and could do with upgrading. When we arrived there were about 10 people behind the desk but none of them called us forward to check into our room. There were no facecloths in the room, and face washing is a must when using the London Underground!"
9,location bed shower,"the bath towels were smallest I’ve ever had in a nice hotel, would not wrap around your body. I asked for more which they happily provided but they were same size!!! I am 5 foot 2 inches and 8 stone so wasn’t asking for much!!"

8,"one of the best hotels in this budget in the neighborhood, great staff especially the concierge",rooms are small and the restaurant food could have been better
9,"very friendly & helpful staff. There were 4 members of staff in reception when we got there so they were very quick to get us checked in & one of them showed us to our room. We turned up about 1.15 & weren’t meant to be able to check in until 2 but the room was all ready. 
It was a really hot day & they’d put the air con on to cool the room down which was really nice. 
We booked a deluxe room which was very nice but quite small.
There were bottles of water & Coke in the room which were free. There was also a small bottle of wine but we didn’t know if it was free so we left it there. 
Breakfast was a full english that you help yourself to. The chef was happy to cook the eggs the way you wanted them.
Check out time was midday which was great as it meant we didn’t have to rush off
The hotel is only 2 minutes walk from Earls Court tube station so a really good location.",The only drawback was that the fridge in the room didn’t work so we couldn’t keep anything cold. We did report it when we arrived but it didn’t get fixed.
9,"Great location close to earls court tube.
Very friendly staff.
Very clean.
12 noon checkout is helpful","Bar closes very early which is frustrating. 
More tea bags should be left in room, but the team will bring you some up.
Breakfast is buffet style and at times was getting cooler"
9,Location was great as we were visiting the Royal Albert Hall for an event and the room was a good size. Bed was also very comfortable and the staff were very friendly.,"I was in a lower floor room and so there was no natural light, as I was going to an event i wasn't too sure how my make up looked as the lighting wasn't amazing in the room."

9,"The location was great- super easy access to Earl’s Court tube station and plenty of food options, but quiet and safe. 
The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were always smiling and welcoming us back or sending us off in the morning telling us to have a great day. We were early arriving, and they had our rooms ready with very little wait (and tagged our luggage to hold so we could go on out and explore if we wanted to). They also accommodated our request to have three rooms together.
Prior to arriving, I had reached out to the hotel with some questions and they were very helpful. 

The rooms were nice (on the small side, but that seems to be the norm in London) and the showers had the best pressure I’ve ever seen :) 
Air conditioning was cool on hot days- a luxury we won’t take for granted after other places we visited on this trip. 
I would stay here again and definitely recommend it!","Breakfast was not great - no a la carte options and the buffet wasn’t very well stocked the day we gave it a try. Everyone was doing their best, and the host was very pleasant. When we were leaving he told me they had just brought breakfast back recently since before COVID, so they might still be working out the kinks (and everywhere we went in England, places seemed to be short staffed.) 

Also, if you’re a coffee drinker, the coffee in the rooms is instant. It did the trick, but there are a few good options on Earl’s Court if you need the real stuff :)"
9,Good breakfast. Very comfy bed. Good shower,More choice at breakfast eg more fruit
8,We really enjoyed our breakfasts. The staff at the Hotel were excellent!,The price of our stay and the room could have been a bit bigger.

8,"Stayed here Monday 30th May-Wednesday 1st June 2022. The staff upon check in were very nice, lead us to our room and carried my bag for me. The room was clean and spacious enough. There was complimentary water too. There was the usual kettle etc. in the room but also a mini fridge and microwave which was great. Bed was spacious and comfortable. Room was in the floor below. No noise. Staff were kind and polite. Didn't spend a great amount of time in the hotel as was out exploring London but the time I did it was good. Wifi was free. Shower had the waterfall shower and a detachable head. Overall lovely stay, good value for money in London and would stay again.",Overall stay was really good. Only suggestions would be that there is better lighting for getting ready when putting my make up on etc. and if they install a towel rail or something in the bathroom to hang towels.
8,"Very convenient as Earl's Court tube station is just down the road. Close to all the sightseeing favourites. 
Staff helpful and friendly. Room comfortable and clean. I would return.","Bedroom decor and colours becoming dated and quite dark.

A wide selection available for Breakfast.","Couldn't fault anything to be honest, the room wasn't the biggest but it was perfectly formed and was well equipped with everything we needed for our stay. For the money we paid it met all our expectations"
8,Breakfast very good although it did seem that while the breakfast staff ran around. There was quite a few stood in the check in area. Not really concerned how busy their colleagues were.,"Definitely getting to our room….. an awful lot of steps. We were taken in a lift, but still ended up walking quite a few flights of stairs."

9,We had a spacious twin room on the third floor. Staying with a friend so was very comfortable. Very good rainfall shower and comfortable beds and pillows. Very friendly and helpful staff on reception. Excellent location for Earl's Court tube station and short distance from Paddington where we came into by train.,A minor thing but the green light just inside the door on the fire alarm (I think) was very bright and didn't allow the room to be fully dark at night.

Bathroom facilities were excellent, with toiletries and bathrobe available in the room.","It’s not what we didn’t like, as this would sound picky, but the lights by the bed wouldn’t turn off using the dimmer switches, so we just resorted to removing the key card. Other than that, it was faultless."
9,"Location perfect, room very comfortable and breakfast superb",Too much single use plastic
7,the location is excellent right next to Earl’s Court tube!! beautiful reception friendly staff.,"not a lot really 
they took a holding deposit of £150.66 I expected to pay the balance due but then had to pay the whole amount again and they refund the holding deposit, only because I asked when I got a receipt to say it had been done. 
 
also one of the twin beds were broken which we didn’t realise until day 2, propped up with MDF I had to use the bathrobes to prop up the mattress and stop my friend rolling out, everything was unpacked so we didn’t want to have to move rooms."
8,Location was excellent. Hotel was very clean and comfortable .,"WiFi didn't work, staff at times could ignore you. Breakfast selection wasn't great. I booked a twin room and while it had 2 separate beds, they were right beside each other, no gap between the beds so we had to pull them apart. No normal breakfast tea in the room"

The staff were very friendly and helpful. our room was smaller than expected but very comfortable and quiet.",Inside the hotel was a bit shabby in places and the carpet on the way to our room was very dirty. Our room was a lot smaller than suggested on the website as described as a superior double!
8,"- friendly staff, they were really helpful !
- hotel located near Earl’s Court Station and several bus stops
- beautiful neighborhood
- clean rooms with facilities
- early check in! I guess we’ve been lucky because our room was available in the morning
- quick check out","Completely independent from the hotel:
- noisy customers
- noisy neighborhood at night (not every night though)"
7,The hotel was in good location for museums and tube stations. Some good restaurants within a 15 min walk. The bedroom was quiet which we very much appreciated and the staff in general were friendly.,"The maintenance in the bedroom could perhaps have been a little higher. Greater attention to details in the bathroom which although was clean, was a little tired in places. The hotel calls the restaurant the Turmeric Kitchen - an Indian restaurant. There was no sign of a menu either at the restaurant or in the room. We decided not to eat there as recent reviews also suggested things had gone down hill a bit. It also seemed very quiet when we passed it in the evenings. Breakfast was Ok but I think a lot of the food had been under warm lamps for some while so things like the bacon and scrambled egg were pretty dry. Service often not very attentive although if a waiter was asked for anything it was brought quickly to the table."

Very clean hotel and excellent location.","Breakfast was adequate but very ordinary, I've had better breakfasts in similar sized hotels."
8,Spacious rooms and the hotel is extremely close to the tube. The staff were friendly.,Getting to the room within the hotel was very awkward. Also our room was located next to a door where the staff sit outside for smoke breaks. which was less than ideal as we came back Sunday night around 9pm and our room stunk of weed. When we didn’t even have any windows open. Breakfast was very average with little variety.

Really good location as well just a minute or so away from Earls Court tube station with good connections to all of London.,"I opted for the smaller room size and if visiting in the future I think I would opt for the bigger room, as space was a bit limited with 2 of us getting ready in the morning.

8,Room was vert comfortable and fridge was a bonus,The breakfast was very poor but staff were very quick to rectify
8,"Before we arrived I requested something special to be done in the room as it was our 21st Wedding Anniversary and they did not disappoint, the room was stunning, swan towels on bed with rose petals, chocolates and wine, fantastic. Front of house were excellent and couldn't do enough for you. Breakfast was really good and much variety to choose from. For 2 people good size room and got what I requested. 1st Class.","Petty things, back of bathroom door needed cleaning, covered in smear marks, bedding had hole in sheets (had no problem changing these) remote for telly would not work correctly. Fridge in room but could not access as locked. Lot of noise in street early mornings, dustmen etc which cannot be helped but if windows properly double glazed would reduce noise dramatically."
8,standard city hotel. has everything you need. location within a short stroll of Earls Court tube but on a quiet road.,Breakfast wasn’t great. No fresh fruit salad or good bread. Scrambled egg overcooked and watery.
8,The location and staff are great.,"The shower clogged everyday, taking at least 10 minutes to drain all the remaining water.
The lights on my room made some weird buzzing noise when they are on. not sure if those experiences where only on my room.."

9,"The attitude of the front desk staff was extraordinary and the room I got was nice and beyond my expectations & so was the breakfast.

Room and bathroom lovely and clean. Surprisingly didn't hear any road noise when in our room as the hotel was on a quiet road. Breakfast very good, ate one evening meal in hotel which was delicious. The hotel bar is within the restaurant so sadly no comfy chairs to sit in for a quiet drink but other than that very happy with our stay. Staff were all lovely.

Room was clean but best of all is the heated bathroom floor!","The have rooms in the basement with no window / view and sadly we got that on our first night. We asked to change room the next day because it feels quite claustrophobic sleeping without a window and waking ip without sunlight. I think they’re used to this issue, as we got a better room with no question asked. Just hoping that they didn’t send us to the basement at all when other better rooms are available."
9,"Excellent staff and great facilities. The room was clean and had complimentary bottled water, coffee and biscuits each day. Great location, just 10 mins walk from Gloucester Road tube station and 15 mins from Kensington High street.

The room and it's facilities were all you needed, including a microwave if you didn't fancy eating out or going downstairs to the restaurant . 5 mins away were supermarkets so you could collect any food to have back in the room. Or get a delivery!
Our stay was built around my husband attending the Cromwell hospital 5 minutes away. He actually had to stay in for 6 days. But I would have breakfast at the hotel then go up and visit him. The breakfast was all you needed from continental through to full English! Perfect!!
On the lower ground floor was a fully equipped fitness room which was just what I needed as I train regularly back at home. 
I ate in the Turmeric restaurant in the evening. Wonderful cooked Indian food and great value for money, in a 4 star hotel!!
Great hotel, staff and location. ****","The thing was the WiFi which was hit n miss. One of the staff came to the room to get my tablet to work but unfortunately it didn't last. I am not brilliant at tech, I must say it may have been me!! But that's the only thing, which in the grand scheme of things isn't much to complain about."

Breakfast waiter was a little curt, we had not booked so asked whether I pay then or later, meaning on check out, he said later so enjoyed breakfast and went to reception to pay and told not on system yet, returned to room then had curt phone call from breakfast waiter asking why I had not paid in breakfast room.

We were greeted with a super fast check in which also helps.
I had mentioned that we were celebrating a special birthday therefore the staff went the extra mile to gift us on arrival with a decorated room, wine, chocolate and cake. It was amazing. 
The room was cleaned daily to a high standard.

Thank you",The only recommendation I would give is that there wasn’t enough tea/coffee making facilities.

The room was very clean, and carpets were fresh-looking with no signs of wear and tear. The price I paid (£75) for one night in a four star hotel close to Earl's Court tube and within walking distance of the museums at South Kensington was extremely low. Good tea/coffee making facilities but I did wonder if the proximity of the kettle to the smoke alarm meant that it could cause occasional false-alarms (I did not experience any of these).","The TV faces the bed and cannot be watched from a chair, only by sitting or lying on the bed. The view from the bedroom windows is not very inspiring, overlooking the flat roof of the back of the reception area, (however this contributes greatly to making the room very quiet)."

Not only was the location perfect, given the straight train from Heathrow Airport to Earl's Court via the Piccadilly line and the hotel itself being a very short walk from the tube station, the room was also very spacious, had everything you could need, and very affordable too. Also, breakfast was pretty great I did not find myself bored of it in the six days spent there. 

As for the WiFi, not only was it a free one that anyone could connect into, it wouldn't allow me to use many apps (including social media) nor visit many websites beyond Google/basic functions. I have no idea why this is the case, but upon relooking at reviews with specific mentions of WiFi problems I realized I was not the only one facing such an issue. Still give this a 4/5 overall as I managed without the wifi by paying for my own data service, however, if you depend on the free wifi you might want to consider staying elsewhere. Otherwise, this hotel is absolutely amazing for its price.",Weak WiFi connection

The cooked breakfast was nice and tasty.","Car parking was an issue (we were booked to come down by train but then the train was cancelled and we had to sort parking) The duvet was not big enough for the bed, it didn't quite cover the mattress. The breakfast was limited - only 2 choices of bread. Only toffee yoghurt. No bananas. The small selection of ham and cheese was dry and turned up at the corners. the apple juice was off"
9,"spotless, lovely staff, showed us to our room, even recieved a call after being in our room for a short while checking if it was satisfactory enough for us. will 100% be back for sure we loved it. plus it’s just off the high street and train station! amazing",can’t think of a thing I disliked

Extremely comfortable bed and great shower. Beautiful breakfast too. And there were robes in our room - a lovely luxury touch.","A couple of minor things: no English tea bags in the room (just herbal tea) and no shower gel in the bathroom (just lots of shampoo).

9,"Very clean hotel, excellent service, polite staff, comfortable room, overall a lovely hotel but with a couple of minor points, a little bit cramped when trying to walk round to the other side of the bed, I kept bashing my leg on the table, bed was very comfortable one other down side there is a bright green light on the ceiling of the room that shines all night, which did cause interrupted sleep.","On the information for the hotel it said that the room had a fridge, this was not so, my husband is diabetic and needs to take insulin daily which needs to be kept in the fridge, when I went to the fridge the morning after our arrival to get my husbands medication it was warm and he was not able to take it as it was no longer effective, when I told reception that the fridge was not working the lady on reception informed us that it was not a fridge but it was a chiller but it did not chill anything that was put in there, cold or chilled drinks etc came out warmer than when they were put in as did the medication I when I told her about my husband medication she told me that they were able to store medication for guests in one of their fridges, not suitable as if required urgently you would have to run down to get it."

Some of the staff are lovely and professional (light brown haired girl working morning of 18th Jan and guy working on 19th Jan in the morning). The wifi worked much better in club double too, no idea why. However, it keeps dropping out on my phone.","Some of the walls and carpets are stained which are off putting. Walls need to be wiped down and carpets perhaps replaced with wooden flooring. It still confuses me why hotels lay carpets. Its so unhygienic, especially in a pandemic. 
None of the staff were masks and we are still in a pandemic. Why?? 
Room service is not easy to reach. Took me several phone calls and I eventually called the restaurant number instead of the room service number."

Rooms were spotlessly clean","It is not mandatory to wear masks/face coverings indoors.

8,location,shower wasn’t great
8,"Room on smaller side but very comfortable and nice bathroom. Tea/coffee facilities in room, location near underground was great.",Water slow to run away in bathroom. The bar in restaurant area had no draft IPA otherwise we would have stayed in the bar for an evening drink despite it being shut off with the restaurant doors which gives the impression it's not open. Perhaps the bar should be located outside of the restaurant for more welcoming feeling.
7,"Very comfy bed 
Bottled water","Room was very dark couldn’t open curtains as was overlooked
No space to lay out laptop etc"

8,fabulous staff and great location. very well located just a couple of minutes from the tube.,"The room is quite small for two people for any length of stay: a night or two probably ok.

Air con needs a bit of attention- any notable change in temp took a long time."
8,"Excellent location,
Friendly and helpful staff
Comfortable room","Double room was short of space around bed and lacked storage space for a stay of over a few days.
Addition of coat hangers would be a quick and easy improvement."

 The shower is very tricky. Can you install something simpler please.
 Its very hard to take a bath and did once.It took an hour to fill up half the tub. Install a simpler system.pleasein 316.
I tripped three years ago and had bruises in the tub.Very slippery,Please install a bar for older folks.
 Miss the bottled water in every room and the newspapers downstairs.

Location was about 5 minutes walk to Earls Court Station and also close to Victoria Station. Nice street too. Shower was good but hard to get into and out of tub as it is a bit deep. Didn’t have the breakfast but they do offer it. They also store luggage if you arrive early. A/C worked well too. Also, found it very quiet so had no issues with noise.","If you store luggage before check in , it is in the lobby, so not overly secure. However, staff is around to watch."
8,Our room was very clean. Lovely shower. Breakfast good and friendly staff.,Bar wasn’t inviting on our return to the hotel. So went out to a local establishment!

8,"Location, easy access for Wimbledon tennis.",Breakfast was average.
7,"This place is all about location - easy walking distance to Earls Court tube stop, the Kensington High Street, and more. Breakfast options were good and the staff were friendly and helpful. They allowed us a 1hr late checkout when we needed to change our onward travel arrangements and looked after our luggage after checkout until we could come back for it.","Rooms are quite small and the facilities are a bit tired overall, but for a short stay for work in a convenient London location this place has everything you need."

7,In a great location about a two minute walk from the tube station in a nice area. Lots of nice places to eat in the locality. The female reception staff were very friendly.,Man on reception sounded like he would rather be anywhere else when we were checking in. Not an ounce of enthusiasm or even a smile. Room was clean enough but glasses were dirty. Have stayed nicer places for less money.

8,Close proximity to the tube and has breakfast available.,"Very slow check in process. On 3 separate occasions during a 3 day stay, our room keys quit working. We would have to head back to Reception and wait … again … for new keys to be made."
7,Location and value for money in a London hotel,"On booking.com website and information you stated amenities in the room were listed but this was not the case. No coffee machine, no waters in the fridge, no biscuits in the room. . You need to stop stating this which are appealing and when you arrive these are not there. This is not acceptable from booking.com. This has happened before with your company."
8,Gluten free bread available on request,"Poor breakfast selection for standard of hotel. Supermarket bread, stale bread rolls and worst of all undrinkable filter? coffee. Espresso coffee offered at £3.25 extra!"

We were upgraded to a larger room which was great as we were there for a week but the bathroom was awkward

The hotel has one lift which is very very slow

It was expensive for the standard of the rooms"

8,"Great location 
Room a little small",Small room
7,Breakfast basic,Bar closed early
8,Some of the staff at the front desk were very helpful and went out of their way to provide information. Breakfast was abundant in selection and quantity and delicious. Cleanliness and maid service was fast and thorough. Location was great. Close to a tube station,I thought the room would be bigger and there wasn’t enough room for hanging up and putting away clothes. The bathroom was cramped with only a shower.
8,"Great location to the tube station and locations. 
Breakfast was lovely and hot - not a vast choice but what more do you need - and if you do there’s plenty of shops nearby to go somewhere else for breakfast.
Bed was comfy a little small so if you don’t want to cuddle up to your other half get a twin! 
Room was nice, all the facilities you needed
There’s tea and coffee near the reception if you need to replenish before the housekeeping. 
Yes there are some places that could do with a once over but don’t be a snob about it! - I’m sure someone could say the same about your house!","A little noisy from the street but it’s London! and you can slightly hear the neighbours - just take some ear plugs! 
It is expensive for the stay, but you’re paying for the location and convenience which outweighed the money aspect of it."
7,"The location is excellent, walking distance to major attractions and just minutes from a tube station.","The room was very small, the bathroom was tiny and there wasn’t much useful storage."
7,"It's close to Earl's Court station, and I was given a room upon my arrival at about 1:30pm.","Nothing in particular, as I have stayed in the same hotel for a couple of times before. Yet the room rate is on a high side."

8,The location was perfect in Earl's Court .... easy to get around and very clean Chic hotel,"The am Breakfast could have a little more variety then only "" The English Breakfast """
8,"Great location one minute's walk from Earls Court Tube. Excellent staff and service - our twin room was actually a double. Before I had a chance to ring down, reception rang to ask if everything was OK with our room and immediately rectified it.","Although breakfast was good, would appreciate natural yoghurt, fried eggs and mushrooms as an option. Also, beds were a little soft but many people might prefer that. One of the bedside lights didn't work."
7,The location worked really well for our stay.,"We found the air conditioning wasn't working in our room, I had to request tea, milk etc. when arrived into the room. The day we booked breakfast was a little disorganised no cups or forks and had to ask twice for a pot of tea, not value for money."

8,"Friendly reception. Fridge, microwave, iron in room very handy should one need to use them.",Not a good lounge area to relax in
8,Great breakfast and great location,N/A
9,Room was of good quality for the price we paid. The hotel was easy to access from the tube station. Breakfast was excellent with a good choice and good products. Staff were timely and efficient when dealing with check-in/check-out,The hotel met my expectations for the price paid. The only thing that could be a little clearer is the signage. We followed a staircase down 5 flights of stairs to get to a locked door at the bottom. There were signs all the way down saying we were going to reception.
8,Great position,Mould around silicone in bathroom
8,"Great location, good lighting in rooms and good bathroom.",Breakfast could definitely be improved.
7,"Location worked well for us,near the tube and local amenities, outside noise disturbed us slightly,we were at the front of the hotel and had the window open. The room wasclean and comfortable","Towel rail was loose and kept coming away from the wall, staff justgot on with their jobs, not alot of interaction."
8,Breakfast was fine,No comment
8,Good room and better than expected accommodation in a good location close to Earls Court tube station. Staff very attentive.,Breakfast was ok....liked the dining area and service was good. However not the best hotel breakfast experience. Specifically the sausages were poor. Fried egg (requested) was the best part of breakfast made to order.
8,"Staff was great. Room was a bit tight but clean and had everything we needed. Beds were a bit too soft for my wife, but I can sleep anywhere. The breakfast buffet was very good. The food was well prepared and plentiful. The restaurant staff was very nice.
The elevator was brutally slow. Always took the stairs down from the third floor. 
The location was excellent. A very short walk from the Earl's Court tube station and close to groceries and pubs.","Overall, nothing that would keep us from staying there again."
7,Breakfast was good. An excellent position,All goid
8,"Its Location was perfect, easy access to the tube at Earls Court.",The bed was too small .
8,"FRIENDLY STAFF AND A GREAT LOCATION, ROOMS WELL APPOINTED AND THEY WERE VERY CLEAN. GOOD VALUE HOTEL IN A GREAT LOCATION AND CLOSE TO THE TUBE. WILL BOOK AGAIN",BED COULD BE BIGGER
7,"I want to make a specific mention of your staff, Alinta. Sh is patient, kind and most helpful from my arrival to my departure. Sh would be the person that I want to stay in your hotel when I return to london","The TV did not work probably. We don’t have ate for 2 days. The safe deposit box did not work for the time we were there.
The towels were missing one day 
For the price we paid I expect a bigger room"
7,Convenient location for the tube,"Not the nicest area, the hotel was a little grubby"
8,The room itself was spacious and I asked if my room had a bath which they made sure to assign for me. This made a huge difference to my stay.,I’d say it needs an update. The furniture in the room was alittle tarnished and parts of the decor were a bit poorly kept. That sort of stuff doesn’t bother me if I have a bath and a comfy bed I’m happy.
8,"Located in a short distance from the earl s court underground station and in a nice neighborhood. The hotel is a grand old building. Our room was at the lower ground floor. We had to walk through a long corridor that reminded me of Doom video play to reach out room. Our room had a view to a small and featureless court at the bottom of a deep recess. The room was fine, comfortable, clean and with modern facilities. Because of the location, the room was dark even when all the lights were on and in the morning. My suggestion is that the lightening should improve, the small court refreshed with some plant boxes and the carpet on the corridor needs to be refreshed/ renewed.",The room didn't have any views to anywhere. It wasn't cheap for such a location. I think future customers should be forewarned if they are booking into this room. The room had a feeling of being in a bunker with no access to sunlight albeit a comfortable one.
9,"Great location, for access to tube station. Helpful staff. Comfy, big bed. Change of towels, every day, was a nice surprise. Bed was made every day.","Stood on a ‘staple-like’ bit of metal, on the first day, near the bed, so not vacuumed as well as it should have been. Would have preferred an extra pillow but none available in the cupboards. No plug points around the bed. Only two by the dresser. Windows not very soundproof… could hear noise and voices from the street. Shower gel not topped up sufficiently."
8,Location. Good breakfast. Services,Small bed. Lack of diversity in breakfast
7,Clean and the street the hotel on is pretty.,The staff was unfriendly
8,"Excellent location 2 minutes walking to tube station and near to restaurants and shops , the staff were very friendly . I will definitely come back again",The wifi keeps disconnecting in the rooms and they only provide free water bottles on the first day snd then you get charged for them if you request .
7,"- Staff was extremely polite and helpful 
- Food in the restaurant was halal and excellent 
- Rooms were equipped with microwave and fridge, which was very helpful.
- Several halal food restaurants were nearby at a walking distance.","- Wi-fi signals were extremely poor. All the time we were using the WiFi of the nearby hotel which was free.
- Housekeeping staff entered the room twice using their own keys without knocking and without checking if the guests were inside."

7,Convenience to earlscourt tube station which is on the picadilly line for Heathrow Airport,Rooms a little small but ok for our 2 night stay
7,"Great location,nice hotel,room was spacious,clean,comfortable and with a street view.","On my departure day,the hotel had a plumbing problem which was not very pleasant as I had to leave unable to wash myself. There was no info by the hotel personnel(I asked one of the cleaning ladies) and of course an excuse from the staff would be nice and acceptable. Also,the night before the tv stopped working."

7,Location had been to it several times in the past,"Power was out in the reception from first day and over the weekend. Breakfast was lukewarm on monday. Tv was replaced first night but no signal all weekend so didnt work. This has clearly changed hands and a lot of the staff had not good english, so it was a struggle sometimes to get what you wanted. Breakfast was ok but could have been better scambled eggs only for a hotel where you’re paying a decent amount for breakfast, no mushrooms, black pudding ie premier inn is better😭"

8,"The hotel is in a great location, the staff are friendly. The breakfast room restaurant is clean and bright and the staff are happy to make sure you have everything you need. It is buffet style but you can order eggs from the chef.",1) Who is slamming the doors? The banging starts at 630 am. I don't know if it's staff or guests buts loud and occurs all morning. Put dampers or governors on the door. I would have changed hotels for this fact but I had no time. 2) The shower is old and there is black mould.

7,"Decent size room for London and the price. bathroom furniture (the basin stand) was in very poor condition and generally requiring sprucing up in the bathroom. shower cubicle tired, but pressure was great! chose a club room and the little extras were novel and appreciated. restaurant was small but decent, no real bar or lounge area. staff were polite and helpful. very close to earls court underground and one line into London without changing.","As with most hotels, unless your paying a lot of money, you will always find fault with the upkeep in places. some noise from the street early in the morning, so glazing could have been better but not a big problem. carpet a bit shabby."
7,Staff were very friendly. Central location .,Room was very small. Room was cold even with the heating on. The bathroom was tiny hard to close the door without stepping into the shower to close behind you.

I could even feel a spring bulge out to one side. No, better mattresses, please.

I thought the bathroom was just about perfect, but the pressure on the shower was weak."

7,"It was true to its advert. This hotel had everything we needed. Very friendly reception, they are very helpful.","Nothing major. The green light in the alarm system in the room is too bright and the room had a green glow, which means the room was not in darkness, which is important to me."

The lift was out of order and was not due to be repaired for another week."
8,Great location and very nice breakfast,Lift was out of order and had to carry luggage down a few flights off stairs
7,Great location close to Earl’s Court tube station. Hotel is well appointed and staff were attentive and welcoming,Breakfast could have been better. The cooked items were cold both days we were there. Don’t think there warming trays are operating correctly.
8,Location,"Room had maintenance issues
 The staff changed my room no questions asked"
7,Great location and for the price youre paying it is a good deal for London,The breakfast was ok
8,"The breakfast was super nice, fresh fruits and everything you would expect from an english breakfast. Location is amazing as you need 3 minutes to reach the tube and the staff was super nice and friendly.",The lift was out and the hallways were not very clean.
9,"Property was very clean and came with all amenities listed. Staff were very pleasant and mannerly, had no issues throughout our stay whatsoever. The hotel is in a fairly central location, lots within walking distance and everything else only a few mins away on the tube, there is a station 2 mins from the hotel.",N/A
8,"Location was handy right between Earl's Court and Gloucester Rd underground tube stations. 
Hotel room was clean and the staff were very accommodating and kind, they allowed us early entry to our room at no extra charge this was great as we had travelled from Australia and were tired from the long trip.","The breakfast was made to order on our first 2 days, but then buffet style on our next 2. The buffet was cold even at 7am when it opened. 
Also, staff cleaning in the dining hall wiped everything off tables onto the chairs and floors, which meant you had to clean your seat each day before sitting down (crumbs etc)"
8,Wifi in room was good enough for business video calls. Bed was comfortable.,Nothing really.
8,Good location - staff very friendly,Room was two two floors under ground.
7,Good place to stay. Nice staff. Underground is near the hotel.,"high audibility in the room, after 22:00 bar is closed and you cant order drinks, no miniba in the room"
8,"Staff are all wonderful and location is perfect on a quiet street only few minutes from Earl's Court station which is only 2 stops to The Royal Albert Hall and musuems also not far from Harrods! Breakfast is good and the hotel is generally very clean. Comfy beds good toiletries plus a fridge and microwave in the room. Complimentary fruit,nuts and water. Bedroom cleaned spotless every day and replenished.The best bit was large make up/shaving mirror in the bathroom. Best of any hotel ive stayed in. Great to apply my make up as i cant see very well!!",Unfortunately the windows dont open so it smelled damp with condensation runnung off the large windows. The net curtains need a thorough clean or replaced as they were filthy so even though the cleaners were amazing management need to sort this. I would have liked softer plumper pillows but that s just me. I would stay again if these were sorted
7,Location was great. Right next to the train station. Multiple food choices nearby.,Some wall outlets didn't work and seemed like there was elevator issues every now and then but could've just been unlucky during that time.
7,"The room was comfortable and clean upon arrival. 

I was able to check in early and check out late (for a fee which is not the norm) 

While the staff was a bit slow, I enjoyed some conversations with them (small talk) and they were very friendly.","The room service could have been much better! Any time I requested something it would either be forgotten or take a long time to be brought to the room. 

I asked for the room to be cleaned while leaving at 10 am, upon return at 7 pm it was still not done. Called housekeeping to clean and they didn't come until 8 pm. refused to change the bedsheets other than every third day. 

I used the laundry service at the hotel and it was late being brought back and prices were not clear. I ended up paying £40 more than expected."
7,"Great location if you want to visit Natural History Museum, V&A Museum, Science Museum, Kensington Palace and gardens.",On our first breakfast stuff member said that a client has to buy coffee himself. I was - say what? At breakfast? Next morning coffee was for free.
8,"Great location, staff very helpful and friendly, great breakfast, room was clean and nice.","Only one duvet on the bed, would have been good to have another one."
7,Good location for our needs. Good value for money,"Reported a problem with TV, which wasn't addressed. Shower was good, but the screen had rusty areas around the frame"
7,Location,Room was quite small
7,Friendly and nice staff,"The water in the shower was cold for 10 minutes before it got somewhat warm-ish and the power of the water was freakishly low and not suitable for women with thick hair and shampoo 😬 but other than that - we found a receipt for a purchase made 6 days before we were even in the country, that was not nice and makes you wonder what else could be not clean 😳"
8,"Everything was very good, especially stuff.",Nothing particularly
7,"The location was good, the room was great, housekeeping was good.","Poor wifi and the staff. The hotel has great product, rooms are nice, cleanliness is priority.
But it lacks the customer service touch. The staff at the recepton are cold, never smile or greet guests. 
At one point I called reception for an adaptor fo my toothbrush and the response I got was- you can come to reception get it. Well that was a first, what hotel asks guest to come down and get something- i was in my pyjamas..
I like the hotel, but feel it is a waste if the staff are not provided with the neccessary training to be pleasant frontliners. It would have made a BIG difference. And of course the wifi was super weak.... i had ro go to Costa to get some work done."
9,"The room was very spacious and had everything one needs including ironing board and iron, microwave and kettle with tea and coffee",The vacuuming of the downstairs corridor early in the morning and no windows in my room
8,I needed a room and it delivered a good room experience,Location .. quietness
9,"Excellent service, warm welcome, great room, big comfy bed.",Just the amount of stairs to get to the lower floor rooms.
8,"I like the breakfast, but it could have boiled eggs or eggs (different from just scrambled), more fruit options and gluten/lactose free options as well.",The bathtube as it was very slippery and I almost fall on my first day. I did inform the recepcionist about it.
8,Excellent location near Earl’s Court which allows you to get into any train to the city center. Cafes and services at a short walking distance. Clean and comfortable rooms which were great in relation to the price. We would stay here again.,"A bit of old fashioned design but we didn’t mind as everything was clean and comfortable.
You could hear people walking in the hotel corridor very easily, so soundproofing could be better, but we are heavy sleepers and this was not an issue for us but might be for other people with lighter sleep."
9,"Although the room was small, it was clean and quiet. 
The hotel is close to Earl's Court metro station, it offers good access to important tourist attractions.
Sainsbury's, local shops, and fast food restaurants are nearby.","We arrived at the hotel in the morning, but the hotel did not provide luggage storage service as in our booking description, and we had to pay for luggage storage at a nearby hotel."
7,Welcoming staff generally,"Had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant.
Breakfast was a little disappointing as one of the serving staff appeared grumpy when spoken to. Also, after clearing tables the waiter took little care in placing crockery and cutlery into cleaning station. This caused excessive and unnecessary noise and spoiled our enjoyment. (He was the shorter of the two male waiting staff) He needs to improve his customer service"
9,👍😊🫶🏼,👍😊🫶🏼
7,"Great location, friendly staff, rooms are nice size, refreshments and mini bar great and the TV has decent channels that actually work. Breakfast was decent for the price of the stay. gave us 2 key cards at no extra cost.","Mould is in the room on the wall where the WC is located on the other side. booked a large double but was given 2 singles pushed together, and my fiance kept disappearing in between the beds. Mattress had zips on it where it could be made into one, but the zips were broken. push button to WC fell off the wall and revealed lots of mould in the tiled boxing in the bathroom. One of the reading lights did not work, rooms are very worn. missing decorative lining on the bed."
7,Staff are very very kind and helpful. My room was clean. Location is great. Very central. Close to two tube stations and buses.,My room was tiny. I should have booked a better room in retrospective.
8,"Great breakfast, had an evening meal and was very nice with surprisingly low prices. They had an electrical problem one of the mornings so lift was not working and breakfast buffet food had gone cold so cereal and a croissant was only viable. Would have been nice if we had been offered a voucher towards an evening meal maybe. But hey ho not to worry.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.

7,"room was awesome, clean and very friendly staff.",Wifi was terrible
7,Great location for Earls Court and a couple of minutes walk from Earls Court underground station.,Very noisy room 1st floor. The room was comfortable but a bit tired.
7,"Great location 5 mins from the tube station, nice walk to the museums etc","The room was not as described , it was smaller and had an interlinking door to the room next door. The heating was broken and the staff on reception asked if they could put a heater in the room . This was not acceptable considering we were paying £250 per night! We asked to be moved and then2nd room was much better and as described on booking.com. 
I asked for a coffee 3 times at breakfast and it never arrived . 
Staff could be more helpful and friendlier"

7,"Location, surrounding food options. Bed was very comfortable, condiments and water provided was appreciated.",Didn’t like the sign we were greeted with that there was no baggage storage. A deal breaker for International travellers for sure. The green light in the room near the door was so bright at night it really disrupted our sleep. I understand the WHS expectations however this light was intrusive..

8,"Location, close to Earl's Court station","No luggage storage on departure.
Wrong size duvet in duvet cover, changed on request"
8,Everything was lovely. But the glass bathroom door was weird .,"Glass bathroom door! Wow!! Weird, no privacy."
7,The room was comfortable bathroom nice and very clean,"The first room allocated was below ground no windows mattress well worn and when sitting on the edge the mattress metal framing jutted out. Rip in the headboard and duvet stitching coming apart.

the second room allocated the telly scarted after around 10 mins of viewing then no signal. just waited for it to catch up. No good if watching a film. But didn't matter as we were out most of the time.

Safe batteries needed replacing"
7,Breakfast good and location excellent. Chef had no issue with accommodating with items not on menu eg fried eggs.,Policy on luggage - holding was not available so very poor service in this area however met a very accommodating and professional receptionist Andrea who held our 2 small bags for a few hours. Going forward luggage retention is going to have a huge impact on the business and management need to revisit that policy asap.
8,"Location was nice. Shops and restaurants around. Room was small but acceptable and very clean.
Stuff very friendly and helpfull.",That we can not stay longer 😀
8,Breakfast,Attention to detail
8,Location,No luggage room upon arrival
8,"Breakfast was OK no more, staff was friendly","Deluxe room was in the basement we changed to upper floor smaller room no as ordered.
Only one towel"
7,Spacious rooms in comparison with London hotels,"Although it is supposed to be 4star hotel they do not offer a place to storage some luggage of the ritual customer . Unacceptable attitude..no manager appeared...FOR UR ATTITUDE,NEVER AGAIN. WE ARE AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVES AND WILL ALL OUR COLLEAGUES KNOW IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS HOTEL"
9,"Excellent location. Room was compact but had all needed facilities i.e. hairdryer, iron, fridge etc. The staff were very efficient. There was a problem with the room safe which the staff dealt with immediately.","The lighting in the room was a little lower than I would like even with all lights turned on. The room we stayed in, the shower drained slowly meaning you were standing in approx 2 cm of water during the shower."
9,Very central location and extremely attentive and friendly staff. The rooms were also very clean. We booked breakfast with our room and can recommend to do this. There was a large buffet and plenty of options from traditional English breakfast to continental breakfast options,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
7,Staff very pleasant and location was good.,"The price! My sisters travelled with me and had a room hugely less than I paid through Booking.com and had breakfast included. I had to pay £13 per day and I paid six months in advance. Disgrace on Booking.com 
Avoid room 112 as high pitch noise. After two nights the hotel did move me to upgraded room."
9,"Under floor bathroom heating
Comfy beds
Good getting system 
Inclusive drinks",The bed was 2 beds pushed together and not secured so they kept moving apart

8,It was close to the underground. The rooms was small but enough room for two. Clean and tidy and found it quiet. Lovely breakfast. Would definitely stay again.,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
8,"We were upgraded to a much bigger corner room (401). This was the second time that we had been given an upgrade at the hotel free of charge,","Room windows in 401 can't be opened because of security, so it smells noticeably more musty and of curry than other rooms we had previously stayed in in the same hotel. 
Staff seem to have trouble communicating with each other and admit as much - messages are dropped between front-of-house, housekeeping and maintenance. Once we returned to the room to find housekeeping cleaning it even though the do not disturb light was on. The cleaning lady said she was told we had requested for emergency cleaning, which was untrue."
8,"Room was a good size and was well-appointed, with a microwave and comfy armchair.","On two occasions we left messages with front-of-house, e.g. request for a new tv remote, an enquiry about an item that had been left in the room after check out, and were told that housekeeping would get back to us but this never happened both times, even after checking back with the staff."
8,The location is very good. A very close walk to earls court tube. The dining room is pleasant and the breakfast options were good. The room was fine. We had a twin room on the 4th floor that looked into a small street. Very pleasant view.,"Unfortunately when we arrived 1.5hrs before check in we were told that we could not drop our bags. We had 3 small bags - 1 wheelie and 2 carry tog bags. This spoiled our plans. It was suggested we took them up to a shop next to the tube station but when we got up there they said they didn't do bag drop. This meant we had a wasted uber ride from Waterloo since there was no point heading straight to the hotel and lugging 3 bags to the nearest attraction that wasnt even on our list and then returning. A wasted afternoon. 
The lighting in the room is awful. The lights are either all on bright or off. You don't seem to be able to separate low lighting by just turning on a lamp. Well we couldn't figure out what to do to achieve that. Pulling the key card out the switch seemed the only option."
9,Fantastic location to Earls Court underground station. District and Piccadilly lines - great connections. Nice boutique hotel feel.,Nothing to dislike
8,Breakfast was very good,Room was clean but curtains were dirty otherwise room was very good
7,The food was excellent and the staff were mainly very friendly.,The cleaning of the room and corridor could have been better. The deluxe room was too small so upgraded to a bigger room which was perfect size at additional cost of £40 per night.
8,Location was perfect. A minutes walk from Earls Court tube station. Complimentary bottles of water and bottle of wine were unexpected.,Nothing
8,"Location was very good very safe the hotel is less than 3 minutes walk to the underground station Earls Court which has train services from and to the Heathrow airport. The hotel is 3 minutes walk to burger king and Macdonald’s and KFC Paul bakery and Nero cafe and small grocery shops. 

The room is good and clean but not fancy but very quiet and safe and simple has microwave and safe box shower ropes.",Do not expect a fancy room. The room is good and clean. The view is to a small street very quiet
7,"Very great location, super close to Piccadilly line. Quite even though we had a streetside room. Big and comfy beds and complimentary coffee, tea and water.","The heating doesn't work properly. It is either boiling hot or freezing. Maintenance came to help, but it was not fixed. Also, we booked this hotel because of location and luggage storage (early arrival and late departure from London). Upon arrival everything was perfect, luggage got stored in secured room. But when checking out, all of a sudden there was no luggage storage anymore. Within the 4 days we were there, they all of a sudden changed policy without giving guests notice. Super weird and not very helpful. After a discussion we just had to leave out luggage unattended in the lobby. Before this incident I would recommend this hotel, now not so much anymore. Pity."

8,"Very friendly staff. Arrived around 12 pm, 3 hours before check-in and the room was already ready. Good location for the price, a short walk form the tube station which brought us into the city centre very quickly. 10/10 would recommend.",The room is quite small and the bar isn't amazing but there are plenty of nice bars in the area. Nothing else is at fault at this location.
8,Clean rooms in quiet neighborhood,Nothing outright- lights were a little difficult to work- I finally figured them out( couldn’t get them to turn off individually)
8,The ease of getting to the tube …,Nothing
8,"Nice area, good breakfast, and helpful staff. The room was ""downstairs"" which is a little hard to reach.","The rooms which are ""downstairs"" are a little hard to reach and getting there you via stairs which need a cleaning."
8,Breakfast was ok but restaurant staff was not pleasant,Do not charge extra for adding onions to omelet and ask restaurant staff more pleasant to clients
7,"Room & Bathroom Clean , comfy bed , good sized room for one nights stay , nice touches - biscuits , fruit , tea & coffe , soft drinks & wine , dressing gowns in room . Friendly , helpful staff .","Disappointed with breakfast , very expensive , we weren't told how the breakfast worked and sat for a while until we noticed others helping themselves to food behind a wall that we hadn't been shown , also my plate was taken before my partner had finished eating , no sign for fried eggs/ boiled so you think only scrambled is on offer"

8,"Breakfast was excellent. Great variety. Room a bit small but comfortable. 
Great stay- can recommend!",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
7,Location great,"I had emailed the hotel well before to ask for an early check in. Got no response and indeed when I arrived, my room was not ready. The receptionist kindly offered me a free upgrade to a room that was already available. He did tell me however, that the room was in the basement. In principle I am fine with that, but I was expecting some natural light. None at all, so while the room was very comfortable, the atmosphere was like in a nuclear bunker. But I appreciate that he offered an alternative and for sleeping, the room was fine. So main complaint… 15:00 check in is much too late. And the breakfast was very ordinary. Would expect more variety of fresh produce and juices for a 4-star hotel. The cooked breakfast was very greasy. And that they only offer filter coffee as part of the breakfast… one has to pay extra for a cappuccino or other variant, that’s just cheap and silly."
9,Ok,A little bit noisy
9,"Spacious room, great location, staff all very nice, great toiletries and water supplied",The room was clean however the shower couldve been a little cleaner

It was good to be able to leave our luggage after checking out and return later in the day to collect.","It would have been nice to be able to have afternoon tea, i.e tea / coffee and a scone or a piece of cake.

A more comphrensive choice on the menu would have been nice."
7,"Great location, helpful friendly staff","The room wasn’t ready when we arrived so we went for a walk. When we came back at the time suggested it still wasn’t ready. However the receptionist did change our room so that we didn’t have to wait any longer. 
We didn’t have robes in the room but after calling down to reception they were bought up to the room."
7,The staff on the front desk were helpful. The location was good,"The breakfast was OK but the staff manning the egg station (identified by a dog eared sign) were indisposed doing other things on both days so we didn't feel like bothering them. Rooms are quite small, but that's a London thing."

8,Didn’t have,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
9,The hotel was in an excellent location for our needs; the breakfast was copious and good. Service was sometimes a bit slow but we were not in a hurry. The staff on reception were very helpful and friendly - and smiling! Very important on wet dreary days.,The room was very chilly when we arrived but this was soon sorted. We would have liked a bath. The shower room was a bit squashed with not enough surfaces for storage - otherwise items got wet. A few more hooks maybe?
7,The location to the train station and local shops,"Very tiny rooms, we had a room below ground level, so there was limited natural light and airflow & no lift to access the room, which is fine normally but with luggage it is more inconvenient, being aware of these room conditions beforehand would have been beneficial"

8,Location was excellent. Staff very helpful and friendly.,Nothing.
8,"The staff were great, really helpful. Room was spacious, we got the club room though. Also bathroom was clean and spacious too. Location is also excellent for central London. A bit far from the East like Statford (we had to go here once) but that is on us and not the hotel. All in all, a near perfect experience for the price we paid.",We reserved a club double room and a double bed was provided...but it was actually two single bed mattresses put together. It was noticeable if sleeping in the middle of the bad as could feel the edges of each mattress. Also the hotel could have smart TVs which is a subtle/cheap but important (to me) improvement.
8,"The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean but a bit small and basic. They have some good room service options - mostly Indian food. The location was fabulous - close to tube station, lots of shops and a huge Sainsbury supermarket. The area was quite nice and safe.",Complimentary drinking water and biscuits only available on first day.
9,"Nice room, friendly staff, good breakfast and great evening meal.","Price of beer, which appeared to have gone up 20% overnight (4.95 a pint on hotel website when viewed on 14/10/23, but hand amended to 5.95 on hard copy menu on 15/10/23"

Front desk staff, ""Anna"" was especially friendly and made sure we were happy with her solutions.","I would like to see face cloths added to the towels in the rooms automatically, rather than having to ask for them.

Staff were particularly helpful.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
8,Great staff in reception and dining area. Very good location within a short walk to Earl Court tube station and various eateries. We stayed here for 6 days in early September and noted the same. Breakfast is also good and hot items are freshly cooked including your choice of eggs. Clean rooms.,The mattress. It was too old and very saggy. Noted this and commented on it during our stay in early September. Also room furniture like timber bed tables and chairs are showing signs of age in varnishing coming off. The hotel could do with a renovation job in these areas which might increase the staying cost but will continue to maintain its 4 star rating. We have stayed in 3 star rated hotels in Europe during our holidays in September that looked newer from renovations and had newer looking room furniture and facilities than Park Grand Kensington. This is not a criticism of staff who are excellent but a suggestion to the hotel management of the Park Grand chain in London for this hotel in Kensington.

7,"Location was very near Earls Court underground . Very easy to move about from there. 
Decor was very nice and room comfortable . Bed was very comfortable and bathroom great size and shower good . Water was very hot, possibly too hot and had to be adjusted down .","The location of our room was very bad . A number of rooms were in a sort of sub-basement area which was not served by the lift . We had to go up in the lit to floor one the along a corridor and down two flights of stairs . These were poorly decorated and it felt like we had been pushed into a overspill area . Although the room was to the same standard as other, I did see a friend in another room and it was the same , the difficulty finding our way and decor or corridor and stairs was very poor . Staff did help my self and daughter down to the room but she had heavy suitcase for inward travel and this did make things difficult especially at check out when we had to manage this ourselves . 
On site restaurant looked very nice but we didn’t use it . 
However having returned from theatre trip I had expected there to be a bar open , which there was not and no sign of reception staff at desk ."
8,We were given a club room on the first floor which was comfortable. The breakfast was good.,We arrived late on the first night so had to take a street level room which was not good for what we had paid.
8,"Location
Staff","Bed very soft and not very comfortable 
Tended to eat breakfast out due to the high price at the hotel"
7,Location was great! Staff really lovely and well equipped room.,"The room was at the basement. Not much natural light. Also if you get a room that’s under the breakfast/bar area like us, it is very noisy. You can hear all the chairs being moved and some sort of machine probably a juicer starting before 7 AM sounding like a “pigeon on steroids”. The room was not very soundproof because ours had a joining door and we could hear everything. For us it was a very short stay so not much point in changing rooms."
8,Great location,Room 007 was difficult to access from the reception area. Even the staff member showing us the room had trouble finding it on arrival.
8,"Location great, near Pubs , restaurant’s and the Tube. Breakfast really good.",Room was a bit small but comfortable.Overall enjoyed the stay.
8,"Lovely friendly welcoming & staff. 
Everything clean and tidy.",The only downside was perhaps no additional restaurant or bar open upon arrival.
8,Location was close to the tube station,Size of the room was very small
8,"The location was great for getting into central London. I had a late check-in but the staff were friendly and helpful. The room itself was a decent size for London (bigger than most). I liked that there were wine glasses in the room in addition to water glasses. The bathroom was super clean and there was an actual bathtub, which was great!","I wanted a king size bed but it was actually two singles pushed together which was not ideal. I was also told that my room had been upgraded when I checked in but that was not the case. The room I was allocated was the room I paid for, so it was a little annoying that I had my expectations raised unnecessarily, but all good otherwise."
8,Cooperative staff,Bar menus showing cheaper prices for draught beer than the price charged and being charged service charge on top when the drinks were ordered and collected at the bar. No ramped access only steps.
7,Very nice location.,Our room was slanted and felt very small for a deluxe double room.
7,Very great location and easy access to tube,I want walk-in shower rather than bath tube as it is safer for short person.
7,Location was excellent. Hotel very clean and staff were great.,"Breakfast variety, choice and quality was below expectations. 
Room below the dining room was very noisy on a morning."
8,"I liked the generous sized light and airy bathroom. I liked that the tea/ coffee facilities in room also included biscuits. 
I liked that housekeeping manager phoned me (just after I told maid that I did not need room cleaned that day) to follow up with me and the manager offered complimentary top ups for room.","It took awhile for hot water to run through to shower, after which shower was excellent. 
It is frustrating at breakfast to be offered tea and coffee and once ordered to be told that coffee ordered will be extra. Interestingly I heard this repeated to other guests during the morning and saw no-one getting coffee after that. The food at breakfast was excellent. It would be nice to have good coffee as well. There were too many staff members hovering around the tables at breakfast on the one morning I was there."
8,"location. Friendly staff, Rooms are OK, but I would expect slightly larger room.",Room a bit small. no proper table.
8,"The staff was excellent, from the time we checked in until after we departed they were friendly. I left my brand new phone at the hotel only to realise after reaching the airport it was missing. I managed to contact the hotel to confirm it was left behind and they were able to hold on to it until I made my way back to collect it. Thank you to the housekeeping and front desk team..",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
8,Location was ideal for the places we were visiting. Local facilities were also good and satisified our requirements.,"Traffic noise during the night, but can't be helped when staying in the centre of the city."

8,Rooms were nice and the staff were friendly and helpfull,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
7,I liked the location. Room was fine for a solo traveller. The breakfast was OK.,"For the first two weeks, the housekeeping times were all over the place. I got back after 4pm a few times and the room hadnt been tidied. I learned to put the green light on and they had it done by 2pm. The supervisor going around late afternoon and checking the rooms is unnecessary and a bit annoying."
8,Location is brilliant. Hotel was clean and staff extremely friendly.,Not too many facilities.
7,"Nice quiet room, huge bed, good location close to Earls Court tube.","Bit of a musty smell in the room which disappeared when the window was opened or air con was on. Only one small, very slow lift to serve all the rooms"
8,Everything was fresh and clean.,The cappuccino wasn't included in the buffet price.
8,"Location
Breakfast options",Small rooms. No access to balcony.
9,The staff were all wonderful and very hardworking. Maria and Anna were always smiling and helpful.,We were put in the wrong room the first night but moved the next day.
7,Breakfast was very good and the location perfect for where we needed to be.,"Think the hotel could do with a good clean carpets are stained, some furniture looks very tired."
9,"Location fantastic , staff very helpful and friendly",Room a little tired
9,"Location was great, the staff were very friendly and approachable.",I thought our bedroom was a little small.
7,"rooms were clean, lots of complimentary water, peanuts, beverages, for one night good enough to stay - the prices weren't as high as other places in london","the layout of hotel is quite strange, my room was in the ground floor, but had to take the lift to 1st floor then walk quite a bit to only have to go down again - 

carpets look stained around hotel could do with a revamp especially if guests are using the stairwells to get to their rooms"
7,Breakfast was extra which was ok but nothing amazing service from staff in there wasn’t great . Location great if your going to Earl’s Court but quite far out of your sight seeing in centre,In the basement room heard all the drains when other rooms flushed view from window a brick wall
7,Friendly and welcoming staff. Very helpful.,Room size quite compact
7,"Great clean hotel, fab location and staff where great, we had a great stay.","The lower floor room 07 didn't have a window. the floor is basement level, it had a high level window but unable to open not or view from. I asked for a replacement room which was not a problem."
8,So central for London and the staff were amazing xx,The rooms were very small

Out both days","Room very cramped around bed area
2 bottles of water in room on day 1 only

9,"Excellent staff, very friendly check in and allowed us to check in early which was most appreciated after a long journey down from Newcastle. 
I was particularly thrilled when we got into the room and noticed the staff had decorated our room with balloons/rose petals and towel art as I had informed them this was our mini moon in London following our wedding. This was a lovely touch and made the start of our stay so special.
The room was clean and serviced daily with fresh towels and everything we needed.
Luggage storage on our check out day was also great allowing us to enjoy our final day in London without the hassle of dragging the bags around.
Location is excellent, you feel like your so close to everything on the tube but far enough out so the street was lovely and quiet on an evening even with the window open.
A lovely stay from start to finish.
Thank you Mr and Mrs Renney",Bed could have been bigger but a minor gripe
9,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"While the breakfast area was excellent, the food choices were a little less than desired"
7,Location and service was great. The personnel were incredibly friendly and welcoming. The hotel is stationed right next to Earls Court metro station.,"The facilities itself need some renovation. The room was clean, but things like the desk were obviously worn out."
8,"We liked the extra large bed size (super king /queen) and the location was convenient. 
Staff were helpful and efficient at the front desk at check in and check out.
Air con and wi fi were good in the room.","The bed was soft, and felt a bit worn out being spongy on the edges. The duvet did not fit to both sides of the bed and certainly not big enough with two people in the bed, so bigger bedding for the bed size please. The shower was ok but lacked the power normally experienced in most hotels.
Only one small lift was very slow for a hotel with this many rooms. 
Also It would be better if there was someone on duty at the hotel late at night when returning from theatre etc for security and safety.

Kettle was noisy in the room and the in room mini bar was not turned on and nothing in it in the club level double room. Fruit was a plate with 3 pieces of fruit, 2 small plastic bottles of complementary water and the only mini bar items were on a table without a price list:1 small coke, 1 small bottle of wine and another soft drink! It was not even obvious if you had to pay for them!
Towels are quite small."
8,The location is really good. Near the underground. Staffs are really helpful,The room that they gave to us initially was very noisy so I asked to change the room and immediately they gave another one to us but unfortunately the ac wasn’t working well.
7,"I am traditional satisfied with English breakfast, and there is also continental option. Near the subway Station, restaurants, very convenient.",Internet and wifi signal is very poor in room.
8,Warm and friendly and helpful staff Comfy bed and everything that you would expect in the room.,"Not quite what we expected as a boutique hotel, but that's our expectation not anything else."
8,Clean and the staff couldn’t of been more helpful,Terrible room on the first floor that smelt of drugs and the neighboring room had creaking floors which kept us awake all night. However the staff immediately moved us to a lovely room the following morning.
8,"Spacious air conditioned room, coffee-tea in room, plus 2 bottles of water for outings",One of the two twin beds squeaks constantly and should be replaced
7,Room very small - rooms were all over the place insufficient signage,Bigger room and reception easier to find
7,It was close to the train station and it has modern style. Very comfortable,Our room was a little dirty. We found drink stains on the wall when we first entered the room.
7,Good location,Basement room …… bit too subterranean for me !
8,"The room was very clean, the facilities were good and it was a comfortable bed. The staff were helpful. It was a great location in London. The bathroom particularly was very nice, great shower for the size of the room.",Unfortunately our room was in the basement so was very dark and the view was out into a grubby alleyway. I do understand that probably accounted for the slightly lower price but might have been good to know this in advance as I would have paid more for a room not in the basement.
7,Breakfast and locality.,Being put in a room below floor level that didn't have a lift.
9,"Staff went above and beyond to make sure we were happy.
The location was amazing. Near a train station, food places etc.","Need more counter space for your things
Need more electrical plugs"
9,It was clean and comfortable for quick stay. Friendly staff. Not for long stays though,Too small for normal standards
9,"The hotel is well appointed within easy reach of tourist attractions and places of interest. Two nearby metro stations made it easy to get around the city. The hotel is restaurant is very good with a varied menu and at reasonable prices. The staff are friendly, welcoming and attentive.","The room we were initially allocated for the first of our three night stay was very small. However, after talking to the reception staff, Faheem and Anna, we were moved to a larger room on the second night. Thanks to both of them for being so helpful."
9,The staff were friendly and helpful,Nothing
8,"It was great to be able to check in when we arrived as we had been traveling for 27 hours, the room was not the one we booked but we choose to take it to be able to check in early and were very grateful.",A lift to the lower floors would have been great. The staff were lovely but there was a bit of a language barrier at times.
7,"good location, convenient for public transport",the wifi was a bit hit and miss
8,The location and staff were both wonderful.,The shower could have been a little cleaner and the update to a smart tv in the rooms would be a great addition.
8,Staff was super friendly and helpful. Very clean,Bed was not the most comfortable but ok
8,"pleasant room and quiet. Fridge, complimentary water and chocolates. great shower",Had trouble with wifi but we managed ok
9,All staff were very friendly and welcoming.,Expensive.
9,"The room was a fairly good size for a city hotel and the price paid. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the room was very quiet (as requested). The complimentary bottle of wine (250ml) and the large box of biscuits were great touch! The staff were friendly.",There was nothing in particular that we did not like.
8,Staff and location. Room was quiet. Location.,Booking.com decided I was 2 people and I ended up paying for 2 breakfasts. The only place to sit in the room was on the bed. It would have been too small for more than one person.
7,Location & Staff,"Need of upgrade in rooms.
Breakfast / lunch- dinner menus continental options"
7,Location & certain friendly staff,"Rooms need upgrade, restaurant menu as well as breakfast buffet could have more continental options included.
One female staff at reception was unprofessional & unwilling to give us our booked room.
The duty manager at the time intervened & was extremely helpful & sorted our issue with no further delay."
8,Staff were incredibly friendly and professional.,"Room was looking a bit tired, with damaged curtains and carpet. Shower drain couldn't handle the waterfall shower head which was a little disappointing."
8,Great location and friendly staff. Room but gloomy but everything you would want in a bolt hole in central London. Would stay there again,One window In whole room was a bit gloomy
8,"The location was perfect, 5 minute walk from Earl's Court Station. The beds were comfortable and the room clean and well equipped.","On the website, the room description inluded robes and slippers, neither of which were provided. Also (and this could just be me!), we were provided with two room keys, one of which turns out to be just a light key, NOT a door key! This wasn't explained on reception and consequently we locked ourselves out, thankfully a very lovely lady from housekeeping explained and used her master key to let us in!"
7,Location was great.,The carpet in our room needed cleaned. The room was quite small for the price.

8,Staff were very helpful and very pleasant. Ideal location and quiet area.,"Some facilities were not working- fridge, and location of safe was very low on the ground,"
8,Location,Rooms were very small
8,"The staff were very welcoming, and I really appreciated the presence of a doorman who carried my big suitcase up the steps of the entrance when we arrived. The hotel is conveniently located a 3-minute walk from Earls Court tube station and plenty of small supermarkets, restaurants, cafe's, and fast-food outlets. The cleaners always ensured that toiletries and the complimentary water bottles were fully replaced, which I really appreciated and I liked the electronic system for indicating when you wanted the room to be cleaned or not. We were on the second floor with a street view which was pleasant. Windows can't be opened (as far as I could tell) but the room always smelt fresh despite this. The air-conditioning worked very well and kept a consistent temperature. There is a main panel above the desk in the room which has sockets for all kinds of plugs, and that was very useful indeed. An iron and ironing board, as well as a mini fridge, were also useful. For London, the room was quite a decent size and it was useful to have a microwave (although we didn't use it). We didn't have breakfast so couldn't comment on that.","One lift for a hotel of this size seemed a little insufficient. The shower made a strange loud noise when it was running (but other than that it worked well). You can hear quite a bit of noise from people in the corridor or adjacent rooms, as well as the street but nothing that disturbed our sleep at any point. I have stayed in better hotels for less money in London in the past, but maybe I just booked this too far in advance to get a good deal."
7,Excellent location for transport,"Not good for a group as only very small lounge area, with very very low seating"
7,"Location was ideal. Very near the tube, lots of pubs and restaurants nearby. Breakfast was good",The initial room we were put in was on the back on the ground floor with loads of noise and basically below ground facing a very tall cement wall with all sorts of mechanical things and a very noisy flock of pigeons
8,"Rooms were nice, clean and comfortable.",Breakfast was average and the orange juice was like acid - yuck! I also left my straighteners (worth £150) in my room and despite ringing the hotel to request them they’ve not returned my calls. Housekeeping must have them!!!

8,"Clean, comfortable, proximity to tube and SW London attractions etc 

Friendly staff","Over priced but within range for London 
Breakfast choices could be expanded"
9,"Breakfast was very good and good value for money. The room was a good size and well equipped. The most important aspect to emphasise was the excellence of the staff, who were exceptionally helpful and attentive. Nothing was too much to ask- reception staff, the gentleman at the door and cleaners were all so kind and helpful to us.",Some aspects of decor a little tired.Breakfast available to 10.30 am would be nice.
7,Room was small but comfortable and had everything needed. Good air conditioning which was essential with the weather. Breakfast was good quality.,The staff were a little apathetic/not particularly friendly or customer focused. Google Maps took me to entirely the wrong place!
7,"The hotel was clean and air conditioning was good which was great due to the hot weather.
Reception staff were friendly and helpful.","Breakfast staff were quite rude, didn't offer hot drinks so we had to ask for this and they didn't provide milk until we asked. Didn't explain the buffet style breakfast we just had to assume. Others were able to order other stuff such as hot chocolate and we were not offered this.
The orange juice was pretty much empty and not refilled.
The room had no view which was not explained pre booking, felt like we were in the basement."
7,Fair,Better breakfast.
8,Generous sized room.,Lower ground floor. No outlook.
8,Great location near tube station. Great breakfast and nice staff.,Small room partly underground.
8,Quick check in. We did not use the breakfast facilities as we needed a break from all previous hotels breakfast offers.,We had problems with the WiFi reception partly the wrong information was given at the beginning.
8,"Easy access to tube and walking distance from south kensington's local attractions (there are many). A lot of delicious food places nearby too. The staff were helpful and the room was comfortable. The room and bathroom were clean. The accommodation also felt quite secure. Overall, very nice stay.","The rooms were not sound-proof, could hear people walking outside the hallway and in other rooms."
8,The location was close to transit and easily accessible.,It’s an older hotel and the bathroom could use an update. it’s clearly well used.
8,"Well located, 3 minutes walk to Earl’s Court underground. The hotel offers comfortable and clean rooms. The staff very polite and helpful.","We stayed the first night in a room on the ground floor , not really a nice place to stay… but then we asked the reception to change for a better one and they put us on the 5th floor, much, much better!"
8,"During my stay I first was in another location of the city, I decided to come closer to the center and the hotel was perfect for that. The staff was very helpful and accommodating from the the first second till after the check-out, special mention to Anna from the front desk who was thinking about every detail that could concern guest comfort. The breakfast was good and varied. Very close to public transportation, restaurants, cafes etc","Nothing noticed, but it was a short stay."

8,"Nice room on 5th floor, small window but adequate. A quiet area with very little street noise. Facilities in the room were good with an excellent hairdryer and tea and coffee making facilities. Generally had everything we needed for a short stay. Onsite restaurant which we didn't make use of as lots of great places to eat nearby.","Only one lift for quite a large number of rooms, didn't like that we were ""upgraded"" to a larger room 2 floors down with no natural light. Although the rooms were large we didn't know if it was day or night!!!!"
8,"The air conditioning was great to have! The room was clean and quiet. The location was great, lots of excellent restaurants nearby. It is just steps from the Earls Court tube station. We walked all over from here, felt very safe. The rooms are just like the pictures and even though the rooms and bathroom are small, the space is well designed and does not feel cramped. The shower was very good.","The mattress in room 001 needs to be replaced or needs new supports. The middle and head end seemed sunk down, but not really uncomfortable, should be fixed though. It is kind of a maze to get to some of the rooms and they don't let you walk through the restaurant which would be easier. I understand that with luggage it would be a problem to walk through the restaurant, but once you are settled, you might eat at that restaurant if you were allowed to walk through it."

9,Great location,would love face towels
8,"The hotel was well located for transport links and pubs and restaurants were plentiful within a short walking distance. The Park Grand was also located in a nice street, quite quiet even though it was not far from the hustle and bustle of Earls Court Road. The club room was well appointed, having a large comfortable bed, bathroom was compact but had a really good shower. Air conditioning was efficient thankfully as the weather was hot for our four night stay.",Only one small lift for quite a number of floors. Room was not as big as the photos suggested. We would not be too critical overall as this is London and it is expensive.
8,Staff lovely. Great location.,Small reception. Hard to find room!
7,"The staff, but two in particular stood out - Rencila, who helped loved us (we were originally put in a basement room which I wasn’t mad about as claustrophobic. She could have left us where we are but went out of her way to help and moved us up to fourth offer. She also, unprompted, offered us bottles of water before we headed off, and was so courteous and friendly, which for me makes all the difference to a stay. Rinish was also exceptionally helpful with our bags and obliging. he saw me struggling with a clothing tag and promptly went to get me a scissors - again, he could have easily done nothing but went out of his way. The hotel had good location but it’s not the building that shines, it’s the helpful staff but particularly the lovely Rencila and Rinish.","Basement rooms with little or no windows - awful if you are in any way claustrophobic 
Breakfast quality - not great"
8,"Staff was helpful, check in and check out was smooth.","The bed was not comfy. Hurts our back. The room is really small, we kept bumping into each other. Pillows were very soft."
7,Friendly staff at the reception,Smell in the room when I arrived
7,good location easy access,"issue with plumbing in room but quickly resolved :) 
wifi patchy not sure if because I was in lower ground

8,Location was great,Bigger beds. Queen size.
9,"The location is excellent and very convenient. The staff are some of the most helpful, professional, and attentive staff I've encountered. They made my experience! Highly recommend. 
They provided fresh fruit, biscuits and water daily.","My bed was very soft and I sank to the bottom. It's surprising as I'm small. They really need to get new mattresses as this was worse than any hotel mattress I've had in Europe the past 6 weeks. 
The wifi was patchy, but adequate."
9,The location is great. The hotel is just a block from Earl's Court tube station. The rooms are nice. It is a good value for London.,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
7,"Excellent location. Walkable to many desirable locations around Kensington, Holland Park including beautiful parks. Extremely close to Earl's Court station which is perfect for connection anywhere in London, including directly to Heathrow. We did this when we left and found it easy, as there are minimal stairs to carry luggage.

The staff were friendly and accommodating, checking us in very early after a long flight from Sydney so we could shower and settle many hours before normal check in. We were also upgraded to a larger room on our second visit at the end of our trip which was lovely.","Please note the standard rooms are very small. It's fine if you don't intend to spend much time in the hotel, and really the area is the draw card. Also be aware that some rooms are below ground so don't have any natural light. This can be a bit disruptive to sleep, especially if you're travelling long distances and trying to get onto local time."
7,the property was nearby the earl station,I didn’t like how the rooms were on the lower ground and no elevator access
7,room was fine - perfect for what you need for a short stay,"paying for breakfast was a bit confusing - having to ""check in"" at the counter before you could pay at the desk. That was confusing and saw many people confused by it."
7,"Nice street, close to Earl’s Court station and walkable to Kensington Park and High St Kensington.",I thought the room was small for the price. The breakfast was very average.
7,The hotel staff was very friendly. The hotel provided complimentary refreshments as well as tea and coffee making facilities which was very much appreciated. The location was also perfect for navigating the tube to central London and the sights.,Dark (a bit smelly) room in the basement (underground) without the possibility to get fresh air. Sagging bed needing to be replaced. Rooms are not soundproof. Hotel staff and guests talking loud in the aisle rendering it impossible to sleep after 08:00.

A very good service from the breakfast staff,The first name got we were put in a ground floor room that faced a bunch of AC Inits and a wall that was home to roosting peigons kept us up during the night. we were moved the next day after complaining. I would avoid any of the rooms that start with 00 especially 006.
8,"The staff were great, really friendly. 
The Breakfast was really enjoyable and plenty of it.
Location was good too, although I'd agrue it wassn't in Kensington, I'd have said It was earls Court, but it certainly didn't dtract from our stay.","Having a fully functioning bar would have been much better, open beyond the kitchen opening times.
The rooms aren't very big, but then we didn't spend that much time in it anyway.
It's very tired and needs some updating, a lick of paint and some new carpets.

I asked for a room that had disabled access, but the bathroom was very small and tight to get in and out of as an able bodied person. The room didn’t really offer good value for money, expensive for what it was really."

We went to the bar for an evening drink which is also the restaurant, there was no atmosphere and staff were busy setting the tables for breakfast. No specific area to relax and have a drink. The barman whilst polite was not friendly or welcoming. If had not been raining we would have gone elsewhere.
Breakfast the food was good but again let down by the staff."

8,"The location near Earl's Court underground station is a real bonus. We found good, reasonably priced restaurants nearby.",The outside window in the room did not fully close. This made it a bit drafty on occasion.
7,"The hotel is close to Earl's Court tube station, which makes moving around the city easy. The room was clean and spacey, with a nice bathroom.",The room's window was stuck due to it being wooden and old. It required attention not to get my fingers hurt.

7,We did not have breakfast at the hotel but rather bought from the local shop. There are plenty of alternatives in the Earls Court area. The restaurant at the hotel did however convey a perfectly respectable impression so I would per se not hesitate to go there.,"We did not really stay long enough and spend enough time in the hotel to find any downsides. The one thing we find to remark on was that the room only had one tube of conditioner, but if that is the only complaint I think the hotel has generally done well."
7,"Very convenient to Earl’s Court Station, lots of eateries and essentials.","Although we were upgraded to a larger room, the king bed ( 2 twins pushed together it appeared) were a bit worn and saggy."
8,"Great location, 3 mins walk from Earls Court underground station.

The location is very quiet and the staff are very friendly and helpful.",The beds in our twin room were not comfortable at all. The mattresses were very spongy and did not make for a comfortable sleep. I would stay here again but make sure I had a more comfortable bed.
7,good value. cool area. great price. clean room.,"The adjoining room door was open to our room upon check in, with a person asleep in the next room. it was difficult to communicate that it was open and we had to tell them several times as they kept insisting it was locked. We asked for a bottle opener, and they said it was in the room. it wasn't. so we called down and they brought bottles of water instead of a bottle opener."

Cost of breakfast not included
Hotel expensive"
7,Wery frendly staff. Good lokation.,The cooler in room works not. The heating in bathrom (floor) works not. Bed not very comfortable.
8,Great location close to Earls Court station. Room was very comfortable and clean.,Room was in back of the hotel past the service area and the window was overlooking an overgrown courtyard and back of other buildings
7,"Location was good for access to transport systems and close to major museum attractions. I ate in the restaurant for two of my three nights and found the food choice and quality good. The check-in staff were very courteous and friendly. The room was clean, quiet and well equipped with microwave, mini fridge, safe and coffee/tea facilities and the bottled water was replaced daily. The double bed was comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was very good.","The room size was adequate for one person but would be somewhat cramped for a couple. There were no chairs, only two stools and a small desk on which to read or write or use a laptop. A rather impractical washbasin made even the simplest washing tricky without splashing the floor and surroundings."
8,"Modern building in a great location within 5 min walk from underground station which made getting to London sites very easy. We felt very safe in the Earls Court area. Close to pharmacy, grocery, and convenience stores. Plenty of food options for any meal of the day including pubs, restaurants, coffee shops, fast food etc. Luggage storage was a big help. Housekeeping services were timely and thorough throughout our stay. The property is pretty well kept and very clean.","Honestly most of the front desk staff did not give off the most welcoming feelings. Whenever we passed through the lobby they seemed to be talking to each other in a low voice or sometimes just silent not even acknowledging us which was noticeable and off-putting in such a small lobby. A small number of staff were more welcoming and open. Our flight was arriving at 6am so before we arrived I had emailed ahead asking if luggage storage was available, which it was, but also was told we could check in early if the room was ready. When we arrived I received a very quick reminder that check in was at 2pm. No ""let me check if any rooms are available for you"" or ""I apologize but we are unable to check you in early, "" which would have sounded a lot friendlier."

Location is great with 4 min walk to Earl's Court tube station and nearby restaurants and shops.","Operating the AC is not intuitive, although there are brief instructions on the AC controller. I had to download the manual to figure out which one of those cryptic symbols stands for the heating mode. Moreover, one of the lights next to the bed and the light in front of the wardrobe were flickering heavily."
9,Location to the tube station. Staff very friendly and attentive.,Room maybe a bit bigger.

8,"great value for money, with a position very close to Earl's Court Tube Station, just 2 minutes away. Nice hotel for the this category in London. Staff very professional that resolved an issue with the room and upgrade it for free.","Wi-Fi connection wasn't great sometime, but good enough to work."
7,The beds were very comfortable and the shower was great.,Overall our stay was fine. The rooms and facilities are becoming quite dated and could do with a revamp. The staff at the front desk was very nice but I was not too happy with the service we received. For example I asked three times for some water glasses (which were missing from our room) and was always told that they were on their way. They never came. And we stayed at the hotel for four nights. I would expect more from a hotel like this.
8,"All staff in/on reception were professional and friendly. They always greeted us and checked all was well. The lift was roomy enough for people plus their luggage. The room was very clean and warm with generally good facilities. Items were replaced daily, including bottled water. The location was handy for the tube. There were several good pubs and restaurants nearby too. Some museums were within walking distance (20mins).","The cover for the duvet had enough overhang at each side of the bed to be tucked in, but it was a bit annoying that the padded duvet inside it was literally the same width as the bed (a narrow double), meaning it wasn’t actually wide enough to comfortably cover us both whilst we were in the bed."
7,good but website photos deceive,slight smell of cigarette… reception desk was very intimidating only men on reception
8,I got a free upgrade,nothing
8,"Clean, comfortable room. Good value for money and a convenient location.",The fire alarm went off at 6am on the second morning of my stay for no reason and woke me up from a deep sleep. This was rather disconcerting but good to know it works efficiently.
7,"I thought the staff were really friendly, especially Rohan, the hotel was good value for money and in a good location. The hotel was easy to find and was clean enough for the oroce.","A couple of the facilities in the room weren’t great, one of the towel rails was broken and kept falling off, we booked a room with a double bed and we’re ‘upgraded’ to a twin room which we didn’t really want, a few features looked a little dated."
7,great location,"room 217 (I think it was) had a boiler built in to a cupboard and was noisy and kept us awake about 5am onwards.

also the window did not shut."
9,nice modern facilities. very friendly staff. good location - easy access to Earls Court tube station and onwards into the rest of the network.,"The walls were quite thin, whilst you couldn’t hear the actual conversation, you were aware of noise from adjacent rooms."
8,The staff were attentive & available.,"I was told after 7:30am that I could park in Premier Inn's car park then found out that that wasn't correct. I was expecting available parking. There was no gym, pool or sauna.There was no shower gel provided."
8,lovely classy property,I didn’t dislike anything. The only thing I wasn’t sure of was the location
8,"Very friendly staff who are happy to help with whatever you need. The hotel was classy and the room was good. The bed was especially comfortable and I had a great sleep. The restaurant is also a gem and I thoroughly enjoyed the food, which I would recommend to any guests staying at the hotel.","Although the room was clean and in good condition, there was possibly some dust in the room or something that could affect people with allergies."
8,"Location was really good, about a 3 min walk from Earl's Court Station and plenty of food options nearby. Staff were exceptional, very friendly and professional, especially Anna who made sure that everything went right during our stay.
The room is equipped with microwave, fridge, TV, kettle and things like water bottles, tea, coffee were replenished daily.","The rooms are a bit outdated and a few things were broken, mainly in the bathroom. Towel rack was loose, soap holder wasn't screwed in, so it would move and almost fall every time you needed to take the soap; single-ply toilet paper of extremely bad quality; the hair dryer was plugged directly in the wall under the coffee table in the room and you couldn't take it to the bathroom, where most people would want to use it. You couldn't open the window due to the handle being broken. Throughout the entire stay there was a persistent smell in the corridors and the room, sort of like musty tobacco, which we couldn't get rid of due to the window issue mentioned above."
8,"From the moment I stepped inside, the staff were super helpful, especially Rohan, Faheem, Anna and Ali. They showed me sample rooms, and assisted with the room booking. The room I was given was large (for London) and clean and comfortable. The location was perfect, only two minutes walk from Earl's Court tube station.","If I had to find a negative comment, the pillows were too hard."

7,"Friendly staff, lovely quiet, clean room. Good hot shower. Location good.",Bed and pillows a little too hard. Breakfast should have been included in the room rate. Would have liked there to have been a bar open for drinks/coffees etc up until around 11pm.

8,"Great location for arriving into Paddington- a pleasant 40 minute walk. Also very hand for the Royal Albert Hall- an easy mile walk. 
Lots of places to eat locally to the hotel. The room was clean, decent quality linen, had a fridge and microwave which is always a bonus. 
Staff we attentive, friendly and helpful.","Room a little compact and bijou, but then we did only want somewhere to sleep, not have a party in. No breakfast tea provided on the tea tray, just fruit/herbal teas. Yes I know we could have asked …."

7,"Very friendly and professional staff, close to tube station, comfortable beds",Decor is a little more tired than in online photos. Shower tray was chipped and bathroom sink didn’t drain properly.

7,Hotel and room were both clean and tidy and the breakfast was ok,The shower had very low water pressure which did not make showering that pleasurable
8,Everything was comfortable and clean and the location was very convenient to public transport. Go to Over Under at the end of the block for coffee/breakfast—it was great.,"The room I was in didn’t have overhead lighting and was below ground level, so it felt pretty dreary there."
8,"good location, & quiet,friendly staff.",at breakfast each morning tea was cold? hot tap not to correct temperature
8,Earl's Court Station is just down the road with District line and Piccadilly line serving it. So convenient to the city and Heathrow Airport. Also plenty of places for food and drink around the area.,There is only one lift serving all the upper floors. A bit inconvenient when many people trying to use the lift.
8,The staff were very friendly and helpful! And the beds were comfortable.,"The hotel could have been doing with a little sprucing up, dirty windows on doors and mirrors in elevators gave a bad first impression. Having said that the ROOM was very clean!"

also gym facilities were not good at all needs upgrade."
7,Good location near the tube station. Staff are helpful,"The rooms are literally in an underground basement and getting a phone signal down there is a joke. I was constantly having to leave my room to go outside to make and receive calls. I have stayed here a few times now but my stay in this room 14 was by far the worst I've ever experienced. Was so annoyed especially with how much I paid for 3 nights here. Couldn't wait to get home. Also my room was like tackling the London underground to get to, down loads of stairs, left turns, right turns, along corridors, through doors, then up more stairs and more corridors. Also even though the rooms have smart tvs they won't connect to the wifi to watch Netflix etc. Probably something to do with the signal again."
7,Location was great. Staff were friendly,Room was way overpriced for what it was. Lights weren't working properly in the room. Door on the shower didn't stop water flowing out

8,"Clean, comfortable and quiet. Well priced, good location and accommodating staff. We were staying over for the Test match at lords between England and South Africa which was the only test England lost all summer and finish within 4 hours on day 3. I had tickets for days 3 and 4 for me and my wife. The hotel understood our difficult day as cricket fans and allowed us to cancel the second night of our day, which saved us money and less aggrieved at the cricket result. We had a nice expansive steak meal at the steak and co near by. It was such a good stay here that it also appears we conceived our first child here, so not a stay we will likely forget.","We didn’t go for the breakfast as it was too expensive, but most hotel breakfasts are overpriced!"

8,"The breakfast was good and you had a choice between English or Continental, staff were very helpful and friendly and the location was just right for what i needed, earls court, tube station Piccadilly line, to airport Heathrow.","room was large and had all you would expect, but the sofa needs recovering or replacing apart from that all else was okay, the room was clean and to a high standard and serviced everyday, just the ware and tare on the sofa."
7,Location,2 teabags in our room :(
7,The hotel is ideally located. Close to public transport and Kensington Gardens. Lots of stores and food options close to the hotel and a very safe and clean area of London. the amenities in the room are good.,"The hotel reception is small so if multiple people or groups are checking in, it becomes quite I comfortable and a long process to get yourself checked in. I don’t believe the cost is worth the hotel, unless location is your top decision factor."
7,"comfortable bed
quiet location",Room was difficult to get to and had no view. (looked out onto a wall with air conditioning units.) Hospitality tray was not replenished each day. Bar shut too early.

the view from the room"
7,staff is doing their job excellent; great location near underground station and in a walking distance to the Kensington Gardens and major museums. Plenty of restaurants and fast food in the near.,On the site and on booking hotel is ranked with 4 stars but this can not be more than old 3 star hotel. Renovation is much needed since everything seams old and much used.
8,"location , staff, breakfast","little space in our room , no chair"
8,Breakfast was average ...6/7,TV....satellite would have made a big difference
8,"The breakfast was excellent, when I asked for an extra for an extra blanket and coffee ingredients they were supplied quickly with a friendly mannwer.","The arrangements with transport companies for travel to and from London Airports could have been better, no information easily available as to what options were available with an indication of costs."

8,clean and friendly,the bed sheets were crumpled
8,people working there were very nice,the hotel gave me a very small room whose window could not be opened as most of the windows . anyway they changed after I asked by chance they had free rooms but I think they should highlight that windows cannot be opened ! that is unbearable !

Too many porters not required."
7,the friendly staff and location,"the kingsize bed I had to share with my son was too short but more problematic also to narrow (I guess only 1,60m wide) that might be cost for newly weds but didn’t add to a good nights sleep for my 2m tall son and me (also 2m tall)"
9,"The location was great,our room was good and the bed was quite comfortable, nice toiletries and soft toilet paper (not the usual cheap stuff)the room had a microwave and fridge too staff were helpful",Some of the sockets didn't work but too be fair there were a lot of sockets so not too much of a problem and the view was of a wall but on the plus side there was no road noise and being in a city that can be a problem
8,"We stayed there before and our visit this time was up to our expectations. I would recommend this hotel, the Park Grand , Kensington. It is in an excellent location for a tourist or a business person.",There are at least 5 steps from the footpath to the entrance door and they does'nt seem to have a wheel-chair lift. (There is a lift inside.) The friendly staff helped me with my luggage and I have no complaints but disabled people should ask the hotel about facilities.
8,The location was good. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent.,The wifi did not work well all the time.
8,"The breakfast was very good value for money especially as the hotel is in London.
The staff were very polite and helpful.
Earls Court Tube station is very nearby.
There are numerous eating places within easy walking distance.
The air conditioning was relatively quiet.
We could open the windows of our room (on the first floor) if we wanted to.","I would have given my experience at this hotel a higher rating if we hadn’t been allocated a lower ground (basement) room on arrival. The room was extremely dark with bars at the window and, as the air conditioning did not work properly, was very hot and airless. After complaining bitterly, particularly as we were told on arrival that we had been given an upgrade due to the hotel being full, we were found a room on the first floor. The new room met all the expectations I had when making the booking about 3 weeks before.

It is worth noting that taxis further into the centre of London are not easily acquired due to congestion charges etc. We were there for a parent’s funeral in Covent Garden and did not want to use public transport. So allow plenty of time to acquire a taxi and for getting to your destination if it is time specific."

Was asked to pay, even though I paid in full, months ago. We didn't get to the hotel till 9pm due ti underground strike. We checked in, then went ti the restaurant where we were asked to select food fast as they were closing. Night 2 we returned to hotel at midnight ti witness an argument between 2 staff & 2 customers about a booking.

The bed was very comfortable, although the pillows less so. The hotel was well situated with plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants nearby. The staff were friendly. We enjoyed our stay.","Although having air conditioning was a great feature and really needed, the unit in our room couldn't be turned down very low so it was at times too cold. There was also a mysterious green light in our room which I assume was something to do with a smoke or fire alarm; this was very bright and interrupted sleep. Breakfast was adequate, but it would have been nice to have more choice of fruit. The stairways of the hotel need to be spruced up, and the carpet replaced as it was distinctly shabby."

8,Staff were attentive and helpful. Location was an easy walk from Earls court station and the range of nearby restaurants and pubs were great.,They forgot to put a bar fridge in the room at first but did put one in when we queried how to keep our supplies cold. Breakfast was good but would have liked plain yoghurt rather than all fruit based.

They provided a baby crib fro free.","I was not happy that the housekeeping did not bother to separate the beds as we requested twin beds. Breakfast is very basic. There is only 1 lift in the hotel. The hotel entrance is a few steps, with no other access so it was not easy for us with a baby stroller. The location is not great, although it is not far from a few cafes and restaurant but too far from other areas such as Harrods, Covent garden etc .. The lobby is too small"

Air conditioning prevented room overheating during the hot weather. Good selection of hot and cold food provided for breakfast. Attractive modern hotel with good decor.,Had to wait an hour for room to be ready on arrival. Room itself although very clean was a bit on the small side.
8,Good location staff friendly and helpful,On arrival was asked if we didn't mind a room on ground level which I presumed was ground floor it was in the basement so no windows which made it very dark this was not explained at reception.i could have complained but just couldn't be bothered to go back up .
8,"The room was a bit small but adequate for our 2 night stay. The location was excellent, just a short walk to Earls Court subway. The breakfast was nice and well cooked.",I didn't like the fact that in this day and age you actually had to pay to get wi-fi connection which spoilt my stay.

7,Staff were very accommodating. Room on 2nd floor had a good view out on to the main Kensington street. Bed was comfortable. Complementary bottles of water were provided - not sure if this was for the hot weather or as standard.,"First room we were given was in the basement, with a tiny window high up on the wall that looked directly out onto another wall, so there was practically no natural light. This was accentuated by harsh, white electric lighting in the room itself. The room was big but did not look like the room we had booked in the booking.com advert. However, reception staff were kind and accommodating when we complained and moved us to a different room without fuss."

8,"I traveled with my mom for a 3 day weekend, as we arrived at the hotel we were nicely greeted by the staff.
A gentleman carried all of our belongings to our room, however, once we got there my mom wasn't pleased with our room. Our view was to a brick wall. 
We immediately called the front desk to see if we could get a different room, the woman at the reception was so kind and didn't ask further explanations or questions, she was very agreeable and got us a different room right away. With a much nicer view!
The rest of our stay was very pleasant. 
The breakfast buffet was good and the staff was again, very pleasant.
Overall it was a very nice stay!","Our first room had a terrible view and we had to go through many different hallways, stairs, and doors to get there.

The location of the hotel was away from busy roads, which I like as they are quieter. The hotel staff were helpful, especially as my keycard didn't work on the 1st attempt. I ate my evening meal in the hotel next door, which was delicious.",My keycard didn't work on the 1st attempt and although this was resolved. I had gone all the way to my room and tried several times to wait to see if it would work. The location of the hotel was a little further away from amenities than I would have liked.

Breakfast could have been more extensive"
7,"Nice staff, comfy beds. Our request to be moved to a room with sunlight was immediately accommodated. The location is exceptional! Right by the tube station with access to the Piccadilly and district line. Walking distance to various attractions.","The first night we were in a basement room, no sunlight whatsoever. For 180 £ a night I did expect more, but then again it’s London and a rather expensive area. The breakfast was not good at all, very bland and few choices. I recommend going to one of the nearby cafes."
7,Good beds,"Very difficult for aged people to get up from a rather slippery bathtub. Breakfast ok, but not great."
9,The hotel is a 5 minute walk subway,We have nothing negative to say about the hotel
8,"Arrived at 9am, and they were able to find a room available so we did not have to wait until 2pm. We were able to sleep as we had been traveling on a plane all night.

7,"I booked a four night break to celebrate my partners birthday, Elis the receptionist was very helpful and friendly, she upgraded our room and sent up some wine, breakfast was good, location was 2mins from Earls court station.","I booked this hotel because of the reviews, and it stated the the rooms had sound proofing, this was clearly not the case we were awoken several times on the first night by the person in the next room slamming doors, and talking which we could clearly hear, we had the same thing on the last night. 
Also, we found stains on the carpet which had a gap next to the wall, the windows were dirty. There was a spare bed, and mattress stored in front of a window in the hallway. We found the menu very limited if you don't like Indian cuisine. It was nice to have complementary soft drinks in the room but no bottle opener provided.
We felt the hotel was in need of an upgrade and a bit more attention to detail was needed."
8,"Close to the station, friendly and helpful staff who arranged taxis for us. Nice bathrobe and slippers to use.",Had a weird skylight in our room that looked like it was taped up with masking tape.

8,"Friendly, helpful staff.
Clean, quiet room. We liked the underfloor heating in the bathroom
Convenient for the tube",Breakfast was good value but not interesting
9,"Ample amenities in deluxe rooms - kettle, microwave, strong WiFi, international plugs, good water pressure, nice views on a peaceful street, bathrobes! This plus the location -- direct on the Picadilly Line from both Heathrow and St. Pancras, easy walk to Kensington High Street -- make for a perfect base in London. Staff extremely kind and helpful.",Mattresses could use an upgrade. Could be an issue for anyone who needs firm support. OK for a day or two.
7,"Excellent location near Earl's Court station. The second room we got was decent. The first one, see below.","We arrived quite late in the evening and apparently the hotel was fully booked, so we got the absolute worst room in the building. I won't post pictures of the ""view"" and where it's located, but that room should not be available for paying guests. I'm not picky, in fact the staff also seems to be well aware of how bad it is, because the next day we were given a decent room without even asking. On one hand it's nice of them to rectify the situation, but on the other hand taking money for a room like that is quite shady."
7.5,Location,Dusty
8,"The location is fantastic, it is very close to the tube. The staff is friendly and helpful and sorted a problem in the bathroom right away. Breakfast was ample and good.","Our room was a bit difficult to get to, one has to go up and down some steps and corridors. Definitely an exercise for navigating, but not a big deal."
8,Nice and clean. friendly staff,Room was a bit small
8,"Excellent location for tube. Room and hotel was quiet at night. All the staff were extremely efficient, friendly, polite and helpful.","Our bath floor felt very slippery when wet after a shower - perhaps some sort of small rail to help get out would be helpful. 
The hot food at breakfast could be a bit hotter."
9,"Very nice rooms, good size (for London), very attentive and kind personnel. Thanks indeed to Elis from the reception, who offered us 2 rooms together and upgraded, thanks to Svilen, but I can say the whole staff is very nice, smiling and supportive. 
The hotel is just 3 min walking to Eearl's court underground station and 7 min to touristic bus.
Good and tasty breakfast buffet","Toiletries of average quality, the bath tube had low pressure, which was fixed after we claimed"

8,Staff were very friendly and accommodating and offered complementary items. Breakfast was also very good and chefs we're accommodating for dietary requirements. All very professional.,"Bed needed new mattress, was significantly sunken in middle. 
No view our of window, was just a walled area. However we understand that some rooms will be this way."
7,Location and staff,"Parts of the coridor to the room including the lift was dirty, old and very unpleasant and we initially thought that is part of the back stage of the hotel.
Other than that, all was great."
7,Location - good breakfast,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
8,"very clean, staff very polite and a great location probably 5 minutes walk from Gloucester Road underground",The bar closed very early probably around 10pm every night
7,The bed in our room was good and staff very helpful and lovely,Breakfast was not what to expect in a 4* hotel. Not worth the money.
8,"Good location close to underground and eateries. Warm, comfortable room. Very welcoming and helpful staff. Good value breakfast. Very nice mini eclairs in reception!",There was a slightly fusty smell in the bathroom. We mentioned this to reception as we were leaving and no doubt it was dealt with.
8,Near to the tube,"They tried to give me a room without window but I didn‘t accept it.
We WLAN is insecured (!) and very slow."
9,Great location & friendly staff,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
7,"breakfast good, bed comfy, room good size and lots of good plug/charge options, really nice shower","pillows not great, bathroom desperately needs a shelf (a bit of space round the sink where things get splashed is not good enough) and the hooks and towel rail made for 6' tall people! Wifi not fast either, and not secured."
8,"Location: within 5 minutes you're at Earl's Court station. Good places to get something small to eat (breakfast or lunch)
Gloucester Road station isn't too far away, but is a short walk (it is the next station). 
Kensington Gardens is within a short distance and easy to reach on foot, as well as Kensington Palace. 

Reception: very motivated and friendly receptionists and I found them very helpful and efficient.","The maid had not been too thorough cleaning the bathroom corners (near the sink). If a toothbrush or a small article falls between the shower and the sink, you might find some unpleasant proof of a former occupant. 

All the sheets should have been changed by the maid, and not only the top one. 
Often the cleaning staff don't speak English well, so it should be communicated to them that fine establishments have guests that are happy to pay for immaculate rooms (and beds). 

We had a Deluxe Double room. This was a bit smaller than a similar establishment I stayed in near King's Cross (with a similar price class), as the bathroom was much smaller at the Park Grand. There is not much room for cosmetics and travel accessories in the bathroom. For a few days, this is ok."
8,A very quiet but convenient location offering comfortable rooms and a good breakfast facility,Rooms are a little small and more thought could be given to the positioning of the wardrobe right next to the bed which makes for a tight space with difficult access to the cupboard and hanging area. Opposite the end of the bed next to the desk would be a better place for the wardrobe with the TV on an angled bracket next to the bed or over the desk - think about it please!
8,"Well presented, clean, friendly staff and right near Earls Court Sation.",No issues.
8,"The location in the Kensington quarter was great, 4-minute walk from Earl's Court on Piccadilly Line, and lots of good options nearby. Bathroom was clean and nice.",Wifi was slow and not usable. Reception area was rather small with not much seating space for more than 3 people to be waiting for a cab etc.
8,"Park Grand Kensington has a lovely staff - intelligent, interactive and caring. Nelly in reception is quite outstanding. Breakfasts were very good, including fresh fruit and a comprehensive range of cooked items. Coffee and tea was provided at reception during the day as were daily papers. Evening meals provided a reasonable menu from which to choose with particular emphasis on Indian dishes. We met some really interesting people at Park Grand Kensington, especially from countries other than UK.",Perhaps the evening menu in the dining room could be extended a little yet without losing quality - eg non-Indian vegetarian dishes.
8,"the location!! really close to Earl’s Court Station, there’s loads of restaurants/pub nearby. very quiet area!",maybe the room allocated (room 007) it’s not that we expected though 😒

7,"I was Upgraded to another room because I was going to leave the hotel when arrived as the room offered wasn't great at all. However, the staff handled the situation perfectly and addressed my concerns which resulted in a great stay.

The room was spacious and the team very friendly and helpful. They couldn't do enough to make my stay comfortable.","The range of food on the menu was limited. Communal areas were limited, small area in reception only. An old bed was pressed against a space on one of the floors (my original room) which wasn't great to see (edges fraying etc)."
8,"Great location. Stylish room, if a little small. Super clean.",Bed wasn't the most comfortable ever

Bathroom is nice. quite expensive in comparison to slightly more updated hotels.

Happy to see the binder with neighborhood recommendations and other info.","Wifi was not strong enough, spotty reception. Neighborhood was a bit further from events and sights than we realized. Stairs to enter the building were not convenient for older travelers or people with heart conditions like my companion. Another guest carried her luggage up. Very kind of him."
8,"Staff. I’d just arrived to my Room and I received a call. The previous guest had misplaced his IPad and the Housekeeping staff wanted to check the room to make sure it wasn’t there. There was no sign of the IPad. 
About 1 hour later I received a knock on my door with a complementary bottle of Wine and a note for complementary breakfast the following morning to compensate me for the earlier disturbance. Fantastic gesture by the Hotel staff.",N/A

8,Perfect location by Earls Court Station.,more healthy options for breakfast

8,Brilliant location. Staff were very helpful with checking in and checking out. We were able to leave our bags after checking out so that we could still enjoy a full day.,No real issues. If you are a light sleeper then you may not like how thin the walls are but it’s not really an issue as most people are respectful and quiet.
7,"The room was clean, microwave in room and shower room was okay. The staff also made sure our bub had a cot which was really nice","We specifically chose this hotel as its advertised that breakfast is halal and there is a sign on the resuarant door showing they serve halal … however at breakfast there was pork sausages, salami, bacon the works … very disappointing when we asked the chef if there was halal options he asked us what halal meant. The windows to the room also are very large and you can see into peoples homes, it’s not the hotels fault just a word of warning if you like privacy in your room, otherwise the room itself aswell as the facilities within we’re okay for what we needed."

8,"Good value, clean hotel. Staff nice.",One day the room was not cleaned until 9 at night despite calling 3 times about it in the afternoon and evening.
7,"Room - upon arrival we were upgraded to a larger room - still not a very big room but did the trick for us as we did not spend a huge amount of time there - bathroom perfect lovely shower - room was cleaned daily but teabags/milk ect were not replaced
Location - ideally located near Earl's Court tube station and a short walk from Kensington
Staff very accommodating and friendly","I do not agree with the 4 star status of this hotel, it's more likely to be a three (walls on stairs approaching rooms were badly scratched). Some areas appeared scruffy like the decór could do with a freshen up. Rooms are limited in terms of space.
Still an ideal stay for a couple of sightseers"
7,Easily accessible location and the room was neat and clean.,A bit noisy at times and we were very close to a staff break area which meant the hallway and sometimes the room smelled a bit of cigarette smoke.
7,"pleasant staff
nice buffet breakfast","very small room, creaky floorboards, gap under door letting light and noise in.
cleaners started quite early for a Sunday"
7,Good location. Clean room.,Small room. Service not ideal - asked for some more milk and tea bags but these weren't forthcoming and too slow

8,"Good location for the Albert Hall.
Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice.","Room was smaller than we expected, bathroom very small."
8,clean and right by tube,it’s a bit deceptive with its name Kensington ? it’s not in Kensington it’s off Earl’s Court road. quite a difference. if you are not familiar with London you would be disappointed you weren’t in Kensington
8,"Room facilities were excellent, recently refurbished and included a fridge, safe, microwave oven, iron and hairdryer. Price of room and breakfast provided great value for money. The hotel is very close to Earl's Court underground station.",The lift was very slow - a minor problem.
7,"location was really amazing and convient next to the Main Street where you can find market train station beauty salon and much more the room was small but clean and they provided us with a baby cot. we ordered coffee for us , a glass of warm milk and some toasts for the baby three times and the staff at the restaurant didn’t change us for it which was very kind and nice of them so over all it was a pleasant and good stay and staff were helpful.","room was too small 
and there was no coffee shop only one restaurant."
7,"Location, perfect for getting around central London. Gym facilities were useful but limited if it had been busier. Staff friendly and very helpful. Upgraded us to much bigger room. Price, less than 400 for 4 nights in such a great location.","Hotel really needs a refurb, fixtures and fittings and decor quite worn out, but we did pay less than 400 I guess. Although we were really pleased to get an upgrade to a much larger room it was on lower ground floor so no windows."

8,"Have stayed here numerous times. Location is excellent near Earl's Court Tube station. Pleasant, safe neighbourhood. Bed excellent. Love fact room has microwave. Staff very helpful. Quiet location.",The hotel is getting very dated. Stains on carpet and public areas beginning to look shabby for a 4* hotel. Rooms also beginning to date with fixtures and carpets needing upgrading. Wi-fi is poor.
9,The staff were very friendly and helpful. It was good location wise as tranport links were nearby. They had chocolates and champagne out free for the guests as it was Valentines. A nice selection of breakfast.,The room was quite small and didn't have a lot of desk space. The bar closed at 10pm which i thought was quite early. The fridge kept making a rattling noise which kept me awake at night.

7,Good hotel location and once I was allocated the standard of room that I had originally paid for I was satisfied with the facilities and cleanliness of the room.,On arrival at the hotel I was told I had been upgraded to a bigger room. The room I was allocated clearly was not an upgrade and was of a very poor standard and not acceptable for the money I paid. Thankfully the staff at the hotel changed my room but this shouldn't have happened in the first place.

Two days later still no money returned to us. 

on check out my brother in law was told he had nothing to pay, the reception staff where instant, then on the train going home was called by the hotel to say he hadn’t paid for breakfast.

7,Being close to Earls court station. Anna was helpful ay the front desk,"I found the staff not very friendly or professional, very inexperienced to be working in the hospitality industry especially considering I was staying at well known hotel chain being the park grand."
7,"We are a returning guest at Park Grand and for us the location is perfect, Earls Court tube literally on the doorstep. The hotel is always welcoming and staff are very attentive. The breakfast offers a fantastic choice too.","Unfortunately the room let us down a little this time, we were on the 4th floor and just before 6am each morning (we stayed 2 nights) a generator of some sorts clicked in, it was a constant drone so no chance of a lie in! That said the room was clean, spacious and the bed was comfy, I just think we fell unlucky with the position of the room."
8,"Great location, near Earls Court tube station. Well appointed updated hotel in an restored building. Staff very pleasant. Perfect for walking to sights or catching tube. Rooms comfortable and bed was fantastic. Nice bath area. Good seating for relaxing as well. Would stay again.",Room was on ground floor with window on sidewalk. Very noisy. No other rooms available since we checked in late. Disappointing.
9,"Localization, breakfast, attention from staff","Beds, the fact you can't leave the lugagge overnight if you are travelling other places from London"
7,Reasonable price and near tube. Looked posh in pictures. Friendly staff.,On arrival we were upgraded to a bigger room but underground with no windows. We moved to a smaller room with a window. The bed had hairs in it when we pulled back the covers. Housekeeping wasn’t available but the front desk guys sorted us out and recovered the situation.
8,"The location was excellent, just a min walk from all amenities along with the tube station, and all the staff was really helpful and supportive, especially Dinesh (if I could recall).",Room sizes are very small. I had to request a bigger room for which the staff did support but in lower basement.
7,"The hotel is very well located a short 3mins walk from Earl's Court making it easy to arrive from Heathrow as well as transit into the city. Considering the cost of hotels in London, I would say this hotel is decent value and the staff were very friendly.","Overall, our stay was good but on the last day, we asked the hotel to call us taxis to go to Waterloo Station. I specified there are 10 of us and they quoted us $60 which I would assume is the total cost for 2 cars but the taxi company (named South Kensington Taxi) charged us $110 for both cars which was outrageous for a ride into the city and they were extremely rude. I provided the feedback to the hotel later and they were apologetic and polite about it as likely they just tried to rip us off as tourists in the end but it put a damper on the end of the trip and I would recommend you use uber if you need a car or ensure the hotel speaks to the driver upon arrival regarding the cost before departure."
7,Great position clean facilities,Room very small
7,"The reception team were friendly. The manager on shift was very friendly, understanding and efficient, he handled my complaint incredibly well. The breakfast service was good, tasty sausage.","The hotel could do with a freshen up, lick of paint, change carpets, re seal bathroom. The basement rooms were dark and dingy."
7,Professional and attentive staff. Bed was comfortable.,"This hotel does meets the standards of that of a 4 star hotel, room and public areas in need of refurbishment. furniture looks worn. economy toilet roll on bathroom and room could do with deep clean. A very light weight duvet that didn’t even fit the double bed, was disguised with flat sheet over the top.
Paid in cash for the room, and had to ask several times for a receipt."

7,"Location was good, close to tube station. Room was good size, but heating did not work properly. Staff was very friendly and helpful, so great service","Bedsheets were not big enough for the bed, so a bit awkward. Heating not working properly, and the shower was not the best."

7,location,carpets in lower levels were dirty and musty
7,"The property is very well located . It was at a walking distance from the subway, restaurants, shopping stores , pharmacies and even touristic places !","Cleaning-less.

pretty outdated . (you can’t even connect to Netflix or connect your phone)"
7,"Our second stay at the Park Grand. 
Staff as before were superb, professional
and friendly.
The breakfast selection is also very good
Location ideally for Earls Court Tube","Our room was located below ground floor
This floor as a whole was very tired, as was the room
The room next door also was a loud guest with
loud music ! The staff dealt with this swiftly.
The room was only average on this stay however,
still good value for money so it wouldn’t put me off 
going again…I’d just request a higher floor!"
7,Good location. nice staff,"the door of the room did not open, it was repaired, the window of the room was 2 meters away from the other house. the shower door was broken, they were repairing it. During breakfast, we had to wait 20 minutes for American coffee, and it was not possible to order cappuccino, because the coffee machine was broken all days"
7,"Great location, nice and attentive staff and good breakfast.","The bed has to be one of the most uncomfortable ones I’ve slept in ages. A very soft and bouncy mattress with which you will wake up with neck and back pain in the morning. 

I found some stains in the mattress sheet the day we arrived. And in front of our room there was some soiled toilet paper on the carpet next to elevator. 

The bathroom is almost claustrophobic of how small it is. Nice shower but with very slippery floor. 

The wifi was almost non existent in the room we were in. If you need it to work, you’re in bad luck. I had to switch to international data plan on my phone almost constantly."
8,"The hotel is in a very convienient location. You can explore a lot and walk around. Great restaurants and tube close to it.

Everything was clean, and the breakfast was delicious.","I booked a deluxe double room for my wife's birthday as we were attending a gig in June. I was disappointed that we were at basement level with no windows, and no natural light. For the cost of the room for two nights, I would have expected to be able to see outside...

Location is great, only a couple of minutes walk to the nearest underground and shops. Yes the room was on the smaller side but it didn’t spoil our trip in anyway.

6,Good location near Earls Court Tube Station,"While our stay was comfortable, there were a few disappointing issues. 
Hotel website states that bathrobes and mineral water are provided in Club doubles. These were not provided. 
On the morning of 11th July we were awakened by a fire alarm. There appeared to be several tradesmen in the hotel at the time. I presume that the alarm was a consequence of their work. However, we received no explanation. 
On the evening of 11th July, television stations were showing no signal messages or were severely distorted.

10,"I thoroughly enjoyed my 1st London stay at this hotel. I arrived before check-in, my luggage was stored until I returned from an event. Chloe & Destin (Manager) went above and beyond. There was a issue in my 1st room, I was assigned a different room on the same floor. The room was not big but it was a suitable size with a microwave and mini fridge. The bathroom had a high bathtub with two showers (hand & overhead). The 5th floor room was quiet. The hotel located away from the main street and traffic noise. Within 3-5 minutes walk to the main street is the underground tube (Earl's Court Station), a grocery store (Co-op), Caffé Nero, McDonald's, Starbucks, KFC and restaurants/stores nearby.","The room doors slam when they close, you have to hold the door handle to prevent it from slamming. The bed was a bit too soft and the pillows were somewhat flat."

The fridge in the room hadn't been cleaned out, as a half empty bottle of lemonade had been left in there.

6,"Great location, clean room","We found the staff to be very cold from the get go & didn’t really seem interested in being there, so we didn’t bother asking them for advice or issues we had with the room. All in all the room was quite good but the Air Con wasn’t working so it was very hot at night, plus the TV could do with an update too as most channels weren’t working. We spent very little time in the hotel anyway so it didn’t really matter but yeah the customer service is really not up to par with a 4 star hotel."

10,"We've stayed at the Park Grand many times & always return. It's a very short walk from Earl's Court tube station, though far enough that's its not noisy. The staff are very friendly & welcoming. The hotel smells & looks beautiful. The rooms are always to a very high standard & the little extra touches, such as bottled water, are always appreciated.","When booking, we'd originally booked for one night, then wanted to extend our stay to two nights. We were told we would have to pay for a completely second night, as opposed to extending our stay. The price for a seperate second night was so expensive, we ended up staying in two different hotels during our two night stay. The Park Grand is a beautiful hotel & we will return again, but sadly feel this was really poor treatment, especially of returning guests & ultimately the hotel lost out as we spent our money for a second night at a different hotel."

The hotel is in a quiet street, has an Indian restaurant where we dined , the food and service were very good. The room was very clean and well equipped with free water, tee and coffee. At the reception, you have also water, tee and coffee free of charge available . The hotel staff was exceptional, cared about small details that denote a high sense of customer service. We felt very welcome at the Park Grand and our stay exceeded our expectations. Special thanks to the reception team , Anna, Mariia, Maxim and Ali , we really appreciated your dedication at all times, 
If we come back to London, we will for sure stay again at the Park Grand.",everything was perfect

10,The hotel is only couple blocks from Earls Court Underground Station. You can get from Heathrow to there and anywhere in the city so easy. Also the room was a good size and comfortable. The front desk staff is very helpful. They will answer any questions and try to accommodate any requests that they can.,The rooms were a bit hot at night. We were supposed to be able to control the temperature in our room but that didn't seem to work.
10,"We loved everything about this hotel. It was super close to the metro - the first bonus. The bed was wonderful and so comfortable. The breakfast - at £12.95 - was well worth the money - and the staff who take care of you in this restaurant are wonderful as well. This was our second stay here during our two month vacation. The first few days we stayed and discovered how convenient it was and we liked the staff so we decided to stay there our last week as well. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks to all the staff who took care of us from the bell boys, the desk staff, the cleaning staff and the waiters in the restaurant.",We had NO complaints.

10,"My room was on the top floor and much larger than I expected, everything looked fresh and new and very clean. Large comfortable bed; microwave and fridge great extras. The room was too warm at first but the temperature was easily adjusted. Plentiful tea and coffee; wine glasses and tissues and a safe all nice extra touches.
The bathroom was very modern, all clean and shiny with lots of towels and good selection of soaps etc. I would have preferred a walk-in shower but I neglected to ask when booking. I didn't have breakfast as I had an early appointment. The dining room is on the ground floor next to reception. The staff were friendly and helpful and I was able to leave my bag whilst out for my appointment.","The WiFi which is provided in all rooms was rather unreliable. A grab handle should be provided for the bath to make it safer for anyone with mobility problems and a shelf over the wash basin would be useful as nowhere to put toiletries, not important for one night but could be for a longer stay. Anyone with serious mobility problems should be aware of several steps up to the entrance."

Location was excellent with good links to public transport.

10,"Upon arrival the really friendly and warm staff: Karina, Ellis and Rinkle greeted us and were of most help from when we stepped foot into the hotel. It was my 50th birthday that day and we only stayed the one night but they did certainly go the extra mile, my room was decorated with petals, chocolates and balloons which was totally unexpected! The cleanliness of my room was immaculate and was of a large size for a double room with large windows that had a view of the impressive Kensington architecture. The hotel is a very short walk from the tube station, around 2-3 mins at the most which is brilliant if going out late and also around 10-15 mins away from the West end and Oxford street.

10,"The staff were really friendly and went above and beyond to make our stay lovely. We even had our room upgrades to a bigger room at no extra cost. The large room was spotless and bed was super comfy. 
Only downside for me would be it would have been nice to have had a proper coffee machine in the room but fresh coffee served with breakfast so it was fine. The breakfast buffet offered lots of choice and definitely filled us up for the day.
The hotel was in an amazing location for restaurant's,bars,shops,parks and museum's. It is literally a 3 min walk from Earls court tube station,where you can travel to all major attractions across London.

The rooms were perfect and so clean, beds were so so comfortable. Me and my boyfriend were so impressed it made our romantic Christmas weekend away even better !! Thank you to all the staff that helped us with our situation, we will definitely be stopping again !","The only problem I can think of is how the rooms are not really sound proof. We was in a room at the front of the hotel and you could hear quite abit of noise outside which didn’t really bother us until there was a man who I think lives in the flats opposite the hotel who was shouting racist things in the middle of the road, screaming, especially to Asian people walking past. Again this is nothing to do with the hotel but I would suggest maybe involving police if it happens again.

On arrival we were told we had been upgraded. We were shown to an inferior room with a standard double bed whose window looked out on a wall a metre away. I reminded the receptionist of my booking, of which she seemed unaware, and we were finally allotted the correct room.
However, despite the high cost, the decor was dark and dated, giving an overall impression of gloom. The sink didn't drain well but most annoying were the bedside bright lights you could only turn off by taking your door key card out of the slot which then turned everything off! Breakfast was uninspired and tired-looking. But the final straws, all noise-related, which have lead me to write a negative review, which I usually avoid, was the scraping of heavy furniture underneath us the first night way after midnight for an hour, the constant loud hum (we must have been over the boiler or something), and someone having a ""malfunction "" with their bedroom door 2 rooms away. The maintenance guys forcibly broke down the door with loud bangs, heavy drills and terrific noise at 10pm for about an hour and a half until we phoned the receptionist. They did stop then but why didn't they simply use a different door key or something quicker to extract the other guests belongings and fix it in the morning? We really felt they should have informed other guests of the problem so we knew what the horrendous noise was about as it was quite alarming.Not a happy visit."
6,"Rooms were tiny, we just used hotel as a base - didn’t eat or drink there",Size of room - we booked a deluxe double - but could barely walk around the bed
5,"staff were very good even when we complained on our first night out off the three night stay about the constant noise of loudly moving furniture from 4am room110 they changed our room a few down 107 which meant we could sleep and said we could have a late check 12.30 out to make up for loss of sleep .
will note the noise was still around but not all night","sadly we feel we were hounded to get out of our room on checkout day we planned to leave at 12. even though we were told it was changed too 12.30
we had a knock on the door asking if we wanted a pillow we had the ZZZ button on which I then turned off then a little after 11 we had the door bell ring and two male staff were asking why we hadn't checked out we explained we were told because off the night off missed sleep and room change we were told we had a 12.30 checkout.they said OK and we continued to get ready to go then the phone rang and my husband answered and know one spock on other end .After 15mins it rang again with the receptionist asking again why we hadn't left it was before 12 .my husband explained again and I was just done and said we will go.we left room and I took the stairs while my husband took elevator. when I got to reception I told them I was very angry with the way we were treated .she said we could stay they didn't know we were staying longer. I said we have packed and we are going and gave the room key cards and we left before we were meant too. this spoilt the long weekend my husband had organised for our 22nd wedding anniversary . it should state what rooms you can hear the restaurant, bar furniture moving loudly or you need to soundproof a lot more .the noise of road and people outside room didn't dive me mad just the loud squeaking of people not picking up there furniture."
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,It was very loud - I assume it was the air condition. The staff was not very helpful when I asked about glutenfree breakfast options.
10,Fabulous location 2 min walk to the tube,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,"Good central location, very close to Earl’s Court tube station.","Breakfast was average at best, plus we had a really annoying continuous drip with our shower."
5,breakfaest was nice,the remote control in our room wasnt working unable to watch the tv very poor
3,Location was good and close to underground,Wasn’t aware Deluxe Double was not so Deluxe. Ended up down a back stairwell next to the bins. Felt like we were in a service passage! Had to get past staff on their break sat on the stairwell a couple of times. Rooms were very small so little room for cases but you would expect this for London. This hotel was labelled as four star but it was far from it.
3,Good location near to Earls Court station. In room facilities were good.,Given a basement room with no window which smelt damp. Requested a different room but was told hotel was full. This was blatantly not true as rooms were still available on Booking.com. Staff not helpful or engaging.
6,"Loved the location. Well off a main road so traffic noise was not an issue.
Crystal the hotel handy man was delightful and very helpful. A good ambassador for the hotel. 
Deluxe rooms were larger than most hotel rooms in London","An adjoining room should not be considered a deluxe room. 
Noise in the hotel was a nuisance, and that was more because of inconsiderate guests arriving home late."
10,Location and the room,"Bathroom - tarnished shower house / missing a cap
Just a few wear & tear places"
6,Friendly receptionists who took our bags for safe storage on arrival early and completion of checking in late after concert had finished in the evening. Given bottled water after none found in room once checked in.,"Disappointed with breakfast service & staff - not offered tea/coffee, cooked breakfast of poor quality and commented on by fellow guests - no poached/fried eggs as option and cheap sausages lacking meat, table not laid so unnecessary argument with waitress over missing cutlery. Told restaurant closing 10 minutes into meal. For a £15 charge way inferior to unlimited breakfast at Premier Inn. Conversation with unhappy guests from Singapore on adjacent table confirmed they were checking out after just one night in the basement where rooms had no natural daylight."
5,The size of the bathroom and the ceil shower,"They need to pay more attention to the small details
The billing system for the restaurant and the hotel needs to be combined 
More coordination between the hotel and its contractors. The contractor changing the entry key cards to the room tried to pressure me to check out earlier. 
More attention and support for elderly 
No access ramp for disable getting into the hotel
Need more variety in the restaurant menu 
Need to change the carpet in some of the walkway and rooms 
The gym is too cramped"
5,"The location was amazing for accessing the Kensington area, restaurants, Natural History Museum, underground and in particular for our trip to Wimbledon.
The bed was very large and comfortable.
The hotel was situated on a lovely quiet street.","The hotel I felt needed an update. The room was adequate and clean, but appeared dated. The size of the room was ok, but I would have liked it to have been bigger for a Club Double Room.
The bar and restaurant did not look inviting and unlike other 4* hotels."
6,The location was perfect for our requirements.,We booked a superior room. I don’t expect a superior room to be in the basement with no window.
5,"Staff: Lovely
Breakfast: Good","Room: bit tired, tv didn't work, shower grouting needs addressing, just a bit dated, but very clean."
6,The location is great.,"The decor is very tired, there were in holes in the curtains."
6,"Perfect Location. Comfortable , clean bed. Pleasant restaurant and staff and reasonable food","We were not expected on arrival.it would appear that booking.com had not confirmed our booking.with the hotel.The staff were very helpful and we were asked to take a seat whilst a room was prepared. The room was disappointing, although clean."
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Our flight was delay by a day which I had emailed to say we would be a day later. When we arrived the reception staff said 'Oh these are the no show guests' which wasnt very friendly. We didn't have breakfast any morning because we were not shown anything or even told what time breakfast was.
5,Location - shortly walk to tube station.,"We upgraded to a club room but we're disappointed as the room was very small and did not include the promised extras - robes, slippers, fruit and extra space"
5,"Location was good, short walk from Earls Court Tube station. Plenty of places to eat nearby. Staff we had contact with were friendly and helpful. Room was clean, plenty of toiletries.","General decor tired, tea and coffee selection in rooms uninspiring for a 4*hotel. Breakfast too a little uninspired, lacking in choice but what was there was okay. Water machine in reception not working nor was the coffee machine in breakfast room…"
6,Location,"Staff not as helpful
Dirty gym with boxes"
5,Clean,Underground bedroom with window onto brick wall. Stained carpets.
5,Property was clean and good selection for breakfast,The mattress was very worn and sunken in the middle and both myself and my husband left with very sore backs and slept poorly because of it
6,Location.,"Walls were paper thin. Floorboards were creaky. You could hear everything your neighbouring room did when they moved. 
Room very small and layout poor."
4,Friendly staff,"Complained about noise coming from air conditioning unit but it was not resolved.
Cleaner knocked on door two mornings when we had asked to not be disturbed."
2,Lovely hotel and was really happy with the first night,"Made Complaints about the room next door partying, playing music really loud and shouting. Made 2 Complaints and was told other people made Complaints. Hotel staff went and told them of the Complaints but didn't do nothing more. Was moved room at 03.30 to a room adjacent to the high street with noise from moving vehicles being a constant nuisance. Not a good ending to our stay - no sleep and very disappointed in the end. Wouldn't recommend to anyone."
5,Close to Earl’s Court train station. Room was clean,"We were put on lower level, 2 floors down with no lift. Very long walk down a hallway that smelled like a really bad musty fart. No view out of window. Made for a bad first impression."
6,"Location was good for Earls Court underground. Room was spacious, breakfast was good, would I stay again, probably not due to how they treated guests.",Their customer service could do with improvement. Food at breakfast was lovely but their service was appalling.
4,"Great location in Earl's Court close to the tube station, restaurants, even Hyde Park.","We paid an average of 190 GBP per night for three nights for a 'Superior Double Room'. For this price and description I expected much more. The room was very small; I had to pivot on one leg to get around the bed. I saw the same room on line priced at 150 GBP during our stay, but we had to pre-pay. I asked for some type of compensation refunded, but all I got was a promise of a nicer room for my next stay. We will not be going back."
6,Location,The most arrogant staff member that decided he could speak over me when I made a slight complaint hospitality is not his forte
6,"The hotel was lovely and clean and the staff kind, polite and very helpful.
I loved the addition of a microwave in the room
because I was able to warm meals. Likewise, the biscuits as well as tea and coffee was a lovely touch.

I am disabled so I appreciated the comfy armchair as well.

Lastly, a good solid wardrobe in the room, iron, hair dryer and good lighting.

Liked the air com in the bathroom. Kept the room cool and fresh.","I felt that the linen could be cleaned more thoroughly because there were a few stains on the quilt cover and general bedding.
The net curtains should be white not grey.
The room was very clean so with these simple additions to the room would make it perfect."
6,"Friendly staff, good breakfast",Problem with mattress which wasn’t sorted until day 2
5,Location and breakfast,"Our room was in the basement and did not have windows. We were not warned about this prior to staying. We felt as though for £205 per night which didn’t include breakfast, there should have been a window in the room."
6,Good location,"Had a noise in the room like a pump that was going off every few hours, that woke us through the night."
3,"Worst hotel we've ever stayed at in London, and we visit about 3xs a year. The wifi is dodgy, barely works, air con was non existent -even after complaining, gym equipment is seriously rusted and bike seats torn up, breakfast was very poor - poor selection and quality. Bed had springs sticking out of it and it was too soft. Staff are exceptional - the only good thing about this hotel. Don't waste your money at this hotel.","Poor breakfast, bad wifi - barely works, air conditioning didn't work - even after it being checked by a weird, hostile repairman. Abandoned gym equipment that needs replacing. Other guests shouting at maitre'd and restaurant staff at lack of table service. Coffee was consistently stone cold over 6 days!!!"
4,Clean,"Incredibly small room, barely able to move around. Thin walls- able to hear next room’s sneeze/walk around"
5,Very expensive for no breakfast and no lounge,Had no mattress protector on bed and there was blood on the mattress. The did put one in when asked. No lounge. For what we paid very poor.
6,"Comfortable rooms, clean, friendly staff",Communal area was a bit small.
6,It was clean beds comfy good location,The breakfast was cold very poor quality
10,The breakfast was great and loved the sausages. The room was fabulous and we were provided with lovely toiletries. Will love to stay there again.,The only thing I can think of was the bed was too soft for me
5,Nice location,"Very uncomfortable bed. Only one towel in room. When we asked for another, the staff member who came with it was not happy!"
6,Near tube and blood access for exploring,Decor was tired shower in bath Personally either a shower or bath The former being best
6,"Room was small, fridge would be cold. Carpet needed cleaning . Location was excellent, Breakfast was better than expected.Coffee was not great. Staff were pleasant.",Lights were out in lobby for two days. Elevator not working.
3,Its location was convenient to the tube.,The internet was out most of the time. The hotel lost electricity in much of the public spaces. The breakfast was uninspired.
6,Breakfast was fine although food and pot of tea could have been hotter for longer. Unfortunately hotel had a power cut in reception and bar all weekend so there was disruption which staff coped with the best they could.,Room was stuffy and not sound proof.
5,Breakfast was ok...staff was a bit busy...had to request coffee 3 times.,Room was like a labyrinth to get to. No hot water for two days straight. No hot showers.
3,Staff did their best in difficult circumstances.,"The power went out in the reception, that caused their systems to be down for the entire stay of 4 days. The internet was gone for a day or two, so was the TV signals. One of the mornings we had no water too, the staff blamed it on that their main pipe was bust. All this seemed like they hadn’t paid their bills for a while, but might just be bad luck."
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Basement room, no water pressure in the shower at all. 
Bedroom had lots of small moths 
No window
No remote"
6,Great location,"Breakfast wasn't great. The food was nice, just not a great selection, and staff weren't helpful."
6,"Location, bed was comfy, bathroom was a decent size and the shower was good!","Our room was ground floor so the window was straight onto the street. Could have done with being frosted or reflective as people stood there a few times.
Also could do with more modern features, I.e. a that we could link to phone /Netflix etc. We were down for the marathon the day before so stayed in the room most of the Saturday so could have done with being able to put what we wanted on there.
The fridge wasn't fixed down either nor on, we tried keeping some bits in there but they weren't kept fridge cold and it was hard to open as it moved around"
6,More fresh fruit.,Nothing in particular
6,Breakfast,Small bathroom
5,Nothing,"Single glazed sliding window in room which made the room freezing and window had condensation on glass all of the time . Could hear a pin drop outside (because of the thickness of glass ) 4mm! Could not sleep at all because you could hear everything from outside never mind , what seemed to be a fog horn going off every 15 mins aswell as pigeons sat on the wall on opposite coming all night !!!!!"
1,Room was fine,Communication from staff. Complaints to management being ignored too.
10,The staff is really amazing. Always ready to answer to the requests and very quick in solving issues.,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
6,Location,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
6,staff were lovely and very helpful,The Room next door was very noisy and it was 12.30 am before we managed to get to sleep. We had to knock on their door at 5.30 a.m. when the noise became unbearable again. The doors banged each time they closed and friends they were staying with were constantly visiting their room and banging the doors. Very little sleep.
6,Very good breakfast,"The first room I had was small, did not have hot water in the evening and there was a persistent humming noise emanating from an A/C unit. upon investigation my room was upgraded and this room was excellent"
5,Breakfast,"Lack of communication
Very loud pipes that would wake us up early in the morning 
Housekeeping was average"
6,"Loved the location. I walked from here through Hyde Park to Oxford Street. Took the tube from Heathrow to Earl's Court station, which is really close. Staff on reception were really helpful, as the room layout is super complicated and they were really nice helping me find my room.","Carpets, particularly in public areas, are very stained. I was in Room 006 and it was super complicated to get to (signage a bit patch on the corridor). Housekeeping forgot to give me water on the second night of my stay."
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Staff on reception unhelpful, staff in reservations unhelpful, manager just ignores emails and complaints."
6,"The location was good for what we wanted - easy short walk to the underground.
The breakfast was disappointing - not a great choice for a 4* hotel.",The breakfast. The restaurant staff weren't very pleasant and didn't clear away plates and when they eventually did they stood at the table whilst they scraped all leftover food onto one of our plates rather than just take them away and come back for the rest.
5,"Location is great, very close to the metro station. Lots of pubs and food choices in a vicinity. Breakfast was nice.","Be super careful with this hotel bc their room guidelines are very misleading. Based on a photos here on booking, I made a reservation for a deluxe double room for 4 nights. What we got was an underground room with no windows and bars on the ceiling above bed (we couldn't see them during the night becouse the glass is painted white). The room itself was nice and big, but a dungeon vibes were super strong. So we complained bc what we paid for definitely wasn't a basement room, but a nice room with window, as shown on the photos. But they didn't have a new room for us on the first night of our stay so we slept with a bathroom light on to avoid the feeling of being burried alive. Tomorrow they moved us to a room on the third floor and we stayed there for 3 nights. When I asked for a refund for the first night they said the basement room was in fact on a ground floor and didn't take my complaint into consideration. Rooms without windows aren't shown on photos or described on the listing, and if I had known that there was a slightest possibility of staying in a basement room for 640 euros, I would have never booked this hotel. How on earth can you even put a word deluxe near a room without a window?

If we didn't complain we would have stayed in a basement room for 4 nights, and they would sell twice the more expensive room.
So before your arrival be sure to check with FOM if your room really is what you paid for."
6,The friendliness of staff,"The location , if I knew they the hotel was in earls court, which you don’t mention clearly on your site I would have chosen another one"
5,The hotel is in a good area and conveniently placed from the tube station and has a lot of eateries in the neighborhood. We are able to get an early checking at 1230 and a late checkout until 2pm which was very considerate.,"Very basic rooms...The toilets had a smell and the pressure in the shower was low. 

The biggest problem we had was that on one evening, while my son and I were changing to go put for dinner, a male staff of the hotel barged into our room..no knocking. He had the key and came straight in saying he was looking for someone.this left both my son and I shaken up. It was shocking that a man could barge into the room.

On complaining with the front office the duty manager was reluctant to share details of the senior hotel managers and also had a very careless attitude on the matter. 

While I plan to report this to the UK authorities I do want other ladies travelling alone or otherwise to know that this is something they may want to ve careful about. While it may have been in error, it clearly shows the lack of training of the hotel staff.

The operations Manager whole apologetic said he couldn't do anything until he had proper evidence and would only investigate when he came back after the weekend. All signs 9f how 9mportant customer safety is to the hotel."
6,The room was nice and as expected.,"Staff were not particularly friendly. I needed to use a computer for work when I arrived. The receptionist allowed me to use the business centre. There were 2 computers - one didn't work and the other had no mouse. I tried to swap it over but it didn't work. The coffee machine had no milk, there were no cups and the area was dirty and untidy. I just gave up and went elsewhere."
5,Location and proximity to tube station,no bag drop
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Really run down tired and scruffy
Bathroom fan won’t turn off
Breakfast was so basic and tasteless"
5,all good apart from lift was not working. You should inform guests immediately after their booking,Lift not working
6,"The staff is friendly and helpful.
But somehow it doesn't feel that the guest is important in this hotel.","Elevator was out of order for up to a week
Showers had issues 
Generally the quality level was down compared to last year.
Breakfast was too basic for the price of 140 euro per night."
10,"Location great few minutes walk from tube station.
Hotel on a quiet road.
Our TV had no sound when I rang reception they sent someone up straight away to fix it.","Lift was not working.
My mattress was sunken in the middle."
5,It was clean,Dark and dingy
6,Location. Very convenient. And very close to the metro lines to the airport and the city centre,"We were accommodated in a room that was, as they said, bigger than the one originally reserved, but in the -2, so in the second basement, with no elevator to get there, and a fake window facing a wall. The first night we were cold, so we checked inside the sheets and we found we were sharing a blanket for a 90cm bed in a 150cm bed. We had to ask for the extra blanket because there were none in the room. Breakfast was not included, so we paid. And it was poor quality for the money."
5,Location.,"Room smelled damp and we had a leak in our bathroom. Asked twice for it to be fixed. Slipped on last day and mentioned it again at checkout to notify manager not to use this room, girls on reception paid lip service and were uninterested. We were over for a family wedding and twenty of us booked there. Poor customer service. Restaurant team very pleasant and food good. Despite booking two hour late checkout for 40 pound, they called our room and chambermaid barged in and woke us!"
10,Close to Earls Court tube station and to South Kensington. Very nice hotel and excellent staff. Rooms were reasonably spacious for a London hotel.,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,location,"Staff were not friendly at all, the front desk staff were not greeting guests just talking among themselves. I found that very unprofessional for this hotel. The housekeeping staff are very nice on the hand. And the supervisors had access to rooms even when you have locked from inside , they just ring the bell and barge in. I was caught off guard once when i was in the bath"
5,"Good location to the tube station. 
Good prices 
Nice bathroom","The room was very small and cramped 
The curtain was broken meaning we could not open it so the room was very dark."
5,location,breakfast
5,The reception were really fast to send up a contractor when our lights broke and they called back to check the status with us,The knob to the lights on the bedside fell off and the main lights timed out every 20 seconds. We needed three different contractors to come to fix it but appreciated their help and it did get sorted
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,No gym facilities.
4,Location,"Sub-basement level room
Uncomfortable room
Bad smell which staff tried to cover with sickly airfreshner
There was a window in room but no natural light due to being two levels under ground which was NOT disclosed when booking 
Poor quality breakfast"
6,"Location , staff, breakfast","Room was small. Not much room to move past each other Bathroom facilities difficult to use . Water flow to bath poor, very difficult to get plug out of bath Curtains in room were broken. Last 3 times have been in much better rooms on floor 5 at similar price. This time we just seemed to have a poor room or a smaller one for some reason"
6,Location,"It is not advertised that rooms are below ground. Fortunately, the staff were able to change us to another room."
6,Well located and close to public transport.,No left luggage facility. When going to London for a weekend it ruins the final day if luggage cannot be left at the hotel for a while on the final day. Not much fun trying to enjoy London with a luggage bag in tow.
6,The Staff were very helpful and knowledgeable about the area and were always looking for ways to make our stay better.,Some of the rooms were too small.
6,Great location and comfortable room,Quite noisy from other guests.
4,Not much!,"Bathroom was tired. Everything you needed needs a request. Staff were under strict instructions to reduce cost. Bar closed before we got back at 21:45. Just felt like guests were an inconvenience. Would NEVER return or recommend. Expensive, poor facility. Close down and let it be refreshed through new owners that are not as complacent."
6,Location excellent,"Staff not very friendly.
Facilities were very basic."
3,Location.,"Staff. 
Not helpful at all. 
Paid for breakfast but we were told on the day, that we'd still need to pay for coffee. I didn't realise that tea was only included in the paid breakfast."
2,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,On 2 occasions I had room service staff walk in without knocking.
6,A few minutes walk to the Underground Earls Court station. Breakfast buffet had a good selection. Beds and room were comfortable. Biscuits provided with tea and coffee. Water free on first day. Iron provided.,Reception staff were not welcoming or friendly. Had to pay for water after the first day. No luggage storage. Staff not helpful in knowing where to store luggage. Small bathroom. Had to ask for towels after room was cleaned. Rooms not decorated like the photos on the website (bedding was plain).
6,"The hotel was well located and bed was comfy, staff were friendly on arrival.","Nowhere to drop bags off before check in made for quite a difficult trip especially when you’re travelling by train which many are in London. Quite a few scuffs in the room and was a bit unclean in places, would probably expect more for the price. Also the corridor near our room had a really musty smell."
6,Location was very central to the Tube etc. Room had good facilities but a little small and quite expensive.,Not much interaction or real help with the staff.
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Staff on reception were rude, cleanliness of the room was poor, stains on the bed, stains in the bathroom"
4,The hotel was in a good location,"The reception staff, on arrival we asked to store one suitcase, as we arrived before check in. The rude staff member just pointed to a sign that said they don’t store luggage. I queried this as I checked this facility was available before booking, only to be told the policy was changed the previous day and they won’t store our bag. I advised that we had not been informed of this change and I was shrugged at. I asked if I could speak to the manager and I was then brought a luggage tag but was told it couldn’t be held in checkout. We then paid to have our luggage stores elsewhere. I understand the change was not down to the staff but their attitude was appalling, worst I have experienced."
4,Cleanliness,Having stayed previously to find that they’ve now stopped storing luggage in the last 7 days and did not notify me was dreadful
6,Location,Room in basement with no windows
5,Convenient Location and quiet .Basic room ok.,"Unwelcoming and dour reception staff.
No option for left luggage,inflexible staff.
Room had some negatives…bathroom extractor not working correctly and carpet by curtains extensively damaged by carpet beetle infestation."
6,Room was in the basement with no natural light dark & dingy,Staff not very friendly and room poor
4,Location was good.,Staff were rude. Couldn’t leave our bags there which meant we had to carry them all round London! Not what I have ever experienced. Rooms were tiny considering we booked “superior double”
6,"There are 2 very nice lights in the restaurant and the food and service for dinner were both very good. You need to pick the right table to get away from the drafty aircon, but our waiter arranged to turn the aircon down which helped. The lamb curry and lamb biryani were the best I’ve tasted. Probably one of the best Indian restaurants we ever been to. Shower pressure in our room was good and the Christmas tree in the foyer looked very nice. Our bed was comfortable and very big. Safe worked ok and lots of sockets and mirrors dotted around the room. Lots of facilities in the room, fridge, hairdryer and even a microwave.","Rooms are on the small side, as is the bathroom, and although the bedding looked fresh, a number of somebody else’s hairs were found when the bed was inspected. There was no bottled water in the room or in the fridge, and TV channel selection was poor, the remote not the best to operate. The room thermostat is fiddly to change from cool to heat, with very little instructions, and the room was a bit cold until I figured it out the next day. Breakfast was ok, but basic. There’s a distinct lack of taxis passing by the hotel so you have a short 5 min walk to the busier Cromwell road to grab one. Not too much of an issue for me but when you have a load of luggage and a 77 mum to contend with, that could be an issue for others. Our Club room was supposed to have turndown service which didn’t happen, nor did the room get cleaned during our 2 night stay. The extra pillows I asked for also didn’t materialise. Oh, and more importantly the bar was never open when we came back from a night out, it was closed before 11 pm, unless there was another bar somewhere in the hotel,which we weren’t told about. Wi-Fi speed / connectivity was not the best in our room."
6,"Location pretty good
Warm","Bedding and duvet was shockingly small
Room very small
Maid service tried at 8.00 am and did not plan to return"
3,Location,Facilities need huge improvements the hotel needs a massive refurbishment beds extremely uncomfortable. Tvs outlets etc are 20 years out of date
6,The location,Hotel room in need of refurbishment
6,Breakfast was reasonably well cooked,"I was given an upgraded room. The receptionist made a big thing of it free of charge 

You can imagine my disappointment to be shown to a basement room with no natural light (Rm2). To cap that the Wifi was dreadfully slow which isn’t good when your trying to reply to emails - the phone had no signal at all. 

Even better when I stood in shower for first time thought the temp was set only to quickly realise the temp tap was broken and just avoided a serious burn."
6,Not much.,"We booked for 2 nights and asked for a quiet room when we booked 6 months ago. They gave us a room on the road which is very noisy with people all night and early traffic. Also the rooms are not sound insulated so you can hear all the doors closing and people talking in other rooms. Also the windows do not seal. Also when we arrived we noticed that the bed had no mattress protectors. Sleeping on other peoples body fluids does not excite. Told the staff but nothing was done. Also the WiFi is not Password protected so you sign into a security compromised interent, beware. Really only a 2 start hotel with a 4 star price."
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Rooms were really tiny. 
We were on different floor from our children despite requesting neighbouring rooms month in advance."
5,Great location and access to local amenities and the staff were polite and helpful.,"The room was incredibly noisy, both from noise outside the property (lorries/ waste collection from as early as 5am both mornings) and noise from other people staying at the property (banging on doors as 2am!😴). Additionally the room was quite light from the fire escape light and a red light on the wall."
10,"Staff friendliness and professionalism, central location, clean and well furnished rooms and very reasonable prices. Strongly recommended.",Double bed size could be bigger
6,"Location good 5 mins Earl’s Court station and upgraded to a club room for not much more , so decent size room .",Bed was quite soft and shower quite small .
1,Nothing About this property was good.,"I was placed in a room without window, two floors under the ground. When l asked to change my room hotel stuff said the hotel is fully booked, which was a lie as they had plenty rooms at that moment on Booking. 
The room was stuffy and had either fan or heating and to switch it l had to call reception all the time.
No phone service at all. 
This was the worst experience that l ever had and hotel stuff didn’t do anything to help me!
Worst stay ever !!!!!"
5,Location,"Couldn’t turn lights off without taking key card out, meaning if you needed to get up in the night it was pitch black…found out on leaving how to do it, the receptionist told us and thought it hilarious that on check in the other receptionist forgot to tell us how"
5,The desk staff were excellent we were moved from a converted cellar room with noisy plumbing without any fuss at all.,"600 for 3 nights very over priced. Leadership was awful Catering staff presented mismatched cutlery every day. Coffee was in a teapot. Tea in a coffee pot. Restaurant menu very narrow. Particularly for an Indian. 
We were placed in a 'bigger' room. Down a filthy corridor behind the kitchen. With a view out on a brick wall and the air con units. Plumbing had been done incorrectly so you could hear water flow though our plughole from others toilets ... this woke us up. They clearly knew about it on the desk. Agreed to move us."
10,Located 5 minutes walk from Earl’s Court station.,Paid extra to upgrade to a bigger room and it was still quite small and cramped. The pillows were really uncomfortable and although room was cleaned daily the amenities were not replaced.
5,Location,Hotel room was a bit old and nothing special
6,"Staff
Breakfast
Location","Bath plug not working 
Curtain track not working properly 
Price for size of room and facilities"
5,"Location was excellent ,Breakfast was pleasant",The room was classed as deluxe double but i did not find it deluxe it was very small and dreary
4,Good location.,"First showed to a basement room and then asked to be moved. Was so awful for £220.. However staff moved us to a level two room which was better however the rooms are dated. Bathroom needs maintenance. Pillows are hard and the TV reception and picture is shocking. Coffee and tea facilities are outdated for the cost as awful sachets of Nescafé. 
I asked for the potential of a late check out as was running the London parks half marathon. Initially I emailed and was told to ask on the day of check in. When I did this I was asked to call back the following morning to see if it was possible, I informed I had to leave at 730 to head to the race and the receptionist said no problem. When I called at 7 am the following morning ( I needed to know if I could leave my bags and return to shower after 12 noon) a security guard answered and informed me the staff didn’t arrive until 8 and he couldn’t make a decision. I won’t ever stay at the hotel again."
6,"Very comfortable bed, good aircon, nice big room, nice breakfast","General maintenance standards eg bits missing from shower controls, generally a bit rundown. Reception at night was not welcoming"
3,"Unfortunately my stay was great I was placed in a room which was in the basement and was old smelling and scary then they moved me but just few doors down which again was so uncomfortable in every way when I opened the window the view was of a wall with a big fan outside, I told the staff aft I was so uncomfortable and unhappy they said they couldn’t do anything about it and would try and move me the next day , I didn’t sleep at all and had a business function the next day","Unfortunately my stay was great I was placed in a room which was in the basement and was old smelling and scary then they moved me but just few doors down which again was so uncomfortable in every way when I opened the window the view was of a wall with a big fan outside, I told the staff aft I was so uncomfortable and unhappy they said they couldn’t do anything about it and would try and move me the next day , I didn’t sleep at all and had a business function the next day , then they moved me the next day was slightly better however, my trip was spoiled, I told them at reception when I left I shall be writing in and would request a refund for the first night , they just gave me a card to contact the manager, and said because I checked in around 9pm that’s why they gave me that room , this is not acceptable excuse , I made this booking a while ago . I shall be emailing the manager with images of the room and the state it was in ."
6,"Location , staff , clean bedrooms and bathroom",Smaller then it looks . Some rooms don’t have a window and in basement .
4,"The location was excellent, near the tube and in a vibrant area but still relatively quiet",The quality of the room was not at all worth the money. We were told we would be moved for night two but then had to push the staff to make it happen. Very disappointing.
6,Breakfast was excellent!!! The rest was pretty mediocre,"Staff were unhelpful, room was tiny , waters and coffees nor refilled daily ?"
5,"Location, and reception staff were helpful there is also tea and coffee in the lobby","Room was too light even with all lights turned off for sleeping and no soundproofing between room, room next to me used their toilet in the middle of the night and you could hear all of it also door slamming"
6,The staff were friendly and courteous. The room was clean.,Our room had a sky light over our bed. It was covered with tape which was a little off putting...
6,"Location was great for us, breakfast was nice. Comfortable bed and large room","We were put in the basement with no window we didn’t like it at all, had to carry bags down stairs, felt like we should have got better for money we paid. Room wasn’t ready on time"
4,Rooms are nice,"For everything they take extra money 
They can’t arrange taxi in normal price"
5,"Convenient location, few minutes walk from Earl’s Court","Could do with a upgrade, the rooms are tired and need a refresh. They are not like the rooms pictured on here."
4,staff friendly ....bedroom good size...breakfast okay bang average produce,"bathroom was very small the taps and the soap dish rusted they looked disgusting ....sink cabinet varnish peeling and chipwood showing wants replacing ....they cleaned the room monday ..the .rest of the week we had to ask for toilet paper and we slept in the same sheets untill the end of the week ....we arrived monday and left friday 4 teabags were provided all our stay we had to provide our own ... all the furniture is getting ready for a change .....rip in the chair just does not look good for £256 a night ..the street the hotel is situated in has rough flats across the road, with people sat outside on the property steps at night does not look good ....i dont like moaning but this is how i felt ... would not stop here again"
4,Staff were lovely and friendly. Good location. Bed was very comfortable,"Stains on bedroom carpets. Shower door was broken, took me asking staff twice for it to be fixed. I asked for water to be replenished but was told it would be chargeable. Lots of water stains on the chrome in the bathroom."

10,Friendliness. Cleanliness,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,"Nothing. It was not a good location for us in the end. Too far away from all the sights we wanted to see. It was very small, not very spacious. The tub did not drain properly. And the small bed for the 3 adult in our group was not very good - a rollaway for an adult!?",See above comments
10,"We got upgraded to the next level room. Service was good. There were complimentary coffee, tea, small bottle of wine and soft drinks.
Stored our bags after check out as our flight was in the evening",Nil
6,Location.,Different room with no view because reception double booked the same room.
10,"Upon arrival front desk notified us that our room wasn’t ready but they were able to check our luggage in so we weren’t hauling it around London. 

The room was spacious for the 2 of us, breakfast included was a bonus. The location was incredibly close to the underground, made it easy to be able to hop on the train and go where needed. 

Staff were incredibly accommodating and friendly, they were open to answer any questions we had. 

As we were celebrating our honeymoon, our room was decorated with flower petals with complimentary wine, chocolate and soft drinks. The staff really went above and beyond to make this special for my husband and I.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Room was in the basement and required considerable effort to access. Anyone with any sort of mobility issue would not be able to access. Being in the basement also made it dingy
6,Staff were nice and accommodating.,The glasses in our room were dirty. The towels and bath robes had a weird scent to them as well. Also was expecting a better TV.
4,"Location was great, breakfast was average","Staff knowing how to
Turn the fire Alarm off at 7am would have been a bonus"
3,Location. Desk personnel friendly.,Booked a Superior double. On arrival desk took us to a BELOW ground room with NO windows. Great start to a bad hotel experience. I complained and they put us up in such a small room that there was no space to open suitcases.
6,Staff were responsive and tried to be accommodating. Rooms were cleaned well. Free Breakfast was very good.,"Residential area location, but hotel name is misleading as location is not in Kensington or South Kensington, but right at Earl’s Court Tube Station! Rooms and elevator are both VERY small, and hotel could use a bit of updating."
10,"Comfortable place, good location, great value & great breakfast",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
6,"The hotel was good in the sense that it was clean , welcoming and functional.

But that is just it it was functional, no frills a boutique hotel it is not. A work hotel in a location that works yeah, I'll give it that","There was nothing boutique about this hotel, it is a good business hotel close to Earls court tube for ease of getting around."
6,Lovely staff,A bit tired
6,clean and close to public transport.,we were downstairs and we felt quite claustrophobic as no windows etc.
3,Room was OK,"Very noisy outside on the street early morning.

6,The location was brilliant.,We were disappointed. The hotel itself was weathered....walls leading to the rooms in desperate need of painting....carpets were also dirty and in desparate need of renewing we wont be choosing this hotel again.

Rooms were tiny with little room to move in."

6,"Hotel was nice , staff were friendly & helpful ,","On arrival , we were told we had been upgraded to a suite ! But the room was in the basement no lift ! & the window in the room was obscured by what looked like dumped old bikes & rubbish. We requested the deluxe room we had originally booked which far exceeded the upgraded suite !!!"
10,"Fantastic staff and breakfast
Good gym",So dated rooms with sticky carpet. Needs a revamp to claim 4 star
5,Location was good,Room was not a deluxe double and aircon was not effective
10,Second visit to this hotel which is located within easy reach of several “must do” attractions when in London. Incredibly impressed by the staff who went beyond expectations to make our stay memorable. Room was large and adequate for our needs. Buffet breakfast with good range of items plus option to order individually cooked items on request. Indian restaurant located within hotel serves excellent food. Based on overall standard of hotel and exceptional service from the staff would definitely stay again.,Large room could have been bettered by the provision of an armchair.
3,Location and nice room,The staff were not helpful at all and the food in the restaurant inedible
10,It was a lovely breakfast plenty of food,The bed slopes one way but it was OK
6,"Nice area, good location close to Earls Court and museums along Cromwell Road.
Very easy to get around.
Breakfast was nice and staff very help ful.","One room was under street level and did not have a proper window. Felt like living in a bunker, sort of. Although the room itselves was comfortable. Booked 6 months in advance and still got that room :-("
1,It seemed nice on arrival and was well located,"I got placed Two floors below ground level and the room smelled of damp, particularly in the bathroom. The room didn’t have a window. On the morning of the second day, in the basement area there was lots of loud shouting in a foreign language which woke me up one hour prior to my scheduled alarm time. This went on for a long time. I think it may have been coming from the adjescent hotel cleaning staff area. I called to make reception aware and the noise stopped very soon after. It didn’t feel like a four star hotel."
5,Nice location,"I’ve been offered a room with no window, despite my booking. only after my complaints I was offered another room on 4th floor"
6,Good location,"Bedroom very small, really a single room"
5,it was quite central fir what we wanted.,"we paid £213 for one night, for a deluxe double room. The bed was very comfortable, but this was definitely not a Deluxe Double room, and not worth the price we paid."
4,"Airy, good air conditioning in the lobby. Staff kept our bags while we were out.","The room we were in even though it wasn’t meant to be a standard room, it was dark with no windows and right by a door to the reception so a lot of door slamming. Our room was also situated by the cleaners rooms so there was a lot of noise from early morning so sleep was very much disturbed."
4,Free water on arrival.,The room was gloomy and old fashioned. Not enough power sockets.
4,Great location to stay,"customer service was poor, 2 cans of cola were missing when we requested change of room."
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,the bathroom sink area is to small
1,The location,"I checked in at Park Grand Kensington on the 27th of May at 3:00 pm sharp and I was really astonished by the beauty and the cleanliness of the room exactly how it appears on booking.com, however, my room was facing the staff room responsible for housekeeping and the moment I decided to rest they started continuously chatting out loud, joking around, laughing really hard, talking on the phone loudly with loudspeaker on, and it kept on going nonstop.
I said to my self its alright deciding to be fair and acknowledging that its 3:00 pm and they do not expect someone to be resting during that time but this is a hotel and they must clearly understand that clients arrive at all times tired from long duration flights and would definitely be in need of some rest.
The next morning on the 28th of May exactly at 7:00 am, I wake up to the sound of their voices chatting out loud almost screaming so they could hear each other and that’s like literally facing my door and it felt like they were with me inside and I couldn’t even get back to sleep this morning and stayed tired all day knowing their noise was not only for a while but was continuous all morning. On my way out, I spoke to the ladies at the reception and informed them what’s going on, they apologized and were really nice where they even called the housekeeping team downstairs over the phone and had a chat with them regarding the complaint so that it is not repeated.
Surprisingly, they couldn’t care less and the same scenario occurred on the morning of the 29th and 30th of May consecutively and it even got worse as I’m getting more tired by the day arriving late at the hotel and having to deal with how annoying they were early in the morning literally at 7:00 am.
I was on a short vacation and stayed at the hotel for three nights and honestly it was my worst experience ever where every day was totally ruined because of the lack of sleep caused by them."
5,"good location
clean
nice size rooms","basement room no natural light
room next to maid / cleaning room - appreciate they have a job but loud voices from 7:30am was a bit disturbing
shower would intermittently spurt out in the night - we think this was when another room flushed the toilet"
5,location,"First room provided was unacceptable- in basement with no window and with a large pillar in middle of room.
Carpets were very grubby and worn in hallways. Hotel decor worn and in need of upgrading."
5,location and Vikram on reception was very good,"breakfast was chaos. no leadership, management or communication between staff at busy times."
4,The location is good. Very close to Earls Court underground station. Lots of shops around. The staff were friendly on the first day but the next shift of staff were very rude and unhelpful.,"We travelled from Australia to the UK for 3.5 weeks. We paid $800 for 2 nights and were given a dark and tiny room on the first floor. Problem was that we were made to take an elevator or stairs to the first level, walk all the way across the property, past the kitchen, through multiple fire exit doors and walk down a flight of stairs to access our room. All the time we are managing our own luggage..(hard to do with suitcases!!) We had to go this way every time we left and returned to the property. When we checked out we had to haul all our suitcases back through the property to leave. Not easy to do...!"
6,that it was close distance to the train station,the property was not equipped with hygiene items like soap and body wash
5,The normal rooms are ok / good.,"The first night we had a terrible room in the basement. But the next room was ok.

Breakfast is terrible. The worst I had in 20years travelling europe."
10,"Clean room and surroundings, good location.. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. The hotel bar was good, did not use the restaurant but it looked quite nice. Rooms are a bit tight, but we managed ok.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,helpful staff,the air conditioning wasn’t working and the sheets were horrible and itchy . poor cotton sheets
6,"Room was clean, facilities were adequate",We were given a room in basement with no windows and natural light. This definitely doesn't help jetlag...
5,LOCATION GOOD,"BREAKFAST POOR
ROOM /BED 2 SINGLE BEDS PUT TOGETHER
NO TURN DOWN SERVICE AS PAID FOR 
NO BATHROBES 
ONLY 2 TEA BAGS"
6,this hotel is located near the station.,The price is expensive compared to the service.
6,Location was good,Quality was not ideal. The rooms were a little grubby and some fittings were poor. This was an adequate 3 star hotel at best rather than an expensive 4 star hotel.
6,close to the tube station,couldn’t switch lights off in room. breakfast was very basic. paid over £50 more then our friends and there room was a lot more spacious than ours very cramped for the cost we paid.
5,staff,a bit dated
10,The staff were extremely friendly and professional. The room was clean. Unfortunately no bath but the shower worked well.,The bed was a little uncomfortable and probably could do with an update.
6,location was ok for Olympia,"bed and pillows were hard, duvet did not cover full bed and the double bed was two singles pushed together and were different heights."
6,"The staff were very friendly and obviously cared that we had a pleasant stay.
The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was well sized with a good shower.",We booked a superior room thinking that this would give us plenty of space for the stay but the room was much smaller than we expected such that it was impossible to fully open the wardrobe door and there was very little room to store our bags. One of the light switches was broken which meant that turning on the light that we wanted became a bit of a logic puzzle. The room and hotel were clean but the decor quite dated.
10,friendly understanding staff,for the length of booking breakfast was not included
6,Very good hospitality,Very very bad WiFi and Internet connectivity
10,clean and friendly staff,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,"Nice room, big and spacious. Very clean too!","I stayed at the hotel as my mother had a operation near by. When my mother came back from the operation, her face was swollen however the staff would stare and their eyes would follow. I noticed all the staff were from India, so not sure if this is a cultural element however it made us feel very uncomfortable. As part of customer service, this should be considered with their customer training. Not respectful for such a lovely hotel - staff let the hotel down!!!"
10,Staff were very helpful and made us feel welcomed room was clean,"My only remark is that the parking is a nightmare and traffic wardens are everywhere ! the hotel should offer pre booked parking this we be better 

Maybe apply and charge for permits under the hotel"
10,The decoration and cleanings of the hotel,Everything was terrific
10,Very nice hotel in a good location! 3 minutes from Earl's Court underground so easy to get to places. Staff was friendly and service was good! Really liked the extra mile of a water bottle a day per guest in the room.,Not really soundproof but the location is quiet so not really a problem.
6,"Extremely convenient location, short walking distance to the Earl’s court tube station.","Room could have been bigger and better equipped, poor quality of toiletries, blanket given was not big enough for two people"
10,The staff were very nice and helpful and all the installations are modern and classy. The location near Earls Court tube station is great for heading into the city and also to Heathrow.,The queen size bed was too big for the room making it hard to walk around it.
6,"Staff was nice and professional.
Facility very clean.
Excellent location for visiting London.
Bed very comfortable.","4 stars hotel, I expected more attention in the level of towels and bed linens as they were really used/old.
There were no automatic refill of shampoo etc products (neither for coffee/biscuits)..was done for the water bottles.
Breakfast extremely expensive for what was offered (competition around didnt make it interesting to try it a second time)."
6,Conceirge was good when asked for directions and helpful,Disappointed rooms didnt match advertisement/marketing
5,"Good location, quiet, clean.","No proper coffee maker in the bedroom, no dressing gowns, sheets did not fit the bed, using the shower was dangerous, the bath was very very slippery to get in and out. The staff were good but all had impenetrable foreign accents resulting one day in a taxi driver being given wrong instructions, luckily I know London fairly well and noticed the mistake ."
6,the staff were friendly and helpful,the photos were deceiving when I was looking for a place to stay. The property was darker and out of date than expected.
5,The rooms were nice and modern,Because it’s a very old combination of buildings it was like a maze getting to my room. There was no way to get a coffee in the lobby once dinner service had finished.
10,location was good for out trip,property was good
4,location,very small room - claustrophobic
5,The receptionist Faheem and a lady came out from the I think the manager they where very helpful and kind.,The room was never cleaned for two days although I have informed the receptionist but was never cleaned also the room was in the basement and the stairs down and up left then right really confusing to get to the Gf.
5,Room was nice,The shower was terrible. It had no pressure at all and was like being peed on!!
6,ideal location comfy beds,"breakfast was a bit chaotic, very disorganised."

Member of staff came into room at 0650 and put the lights on, didn’t knock on the door, thought there was an emergency in the room."
6,The location and the large comfortable bed.,We had a basement room with no natural light in it. The lights in the room were temperamental and the noise of the fan and scraping furniture from above were frustrating at times.
4,location,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,Good location.,"We booked for our Wedding Anniversary and was told they would make it special for us, this didn’t happen. We mentioned this when we left to go out for the afternoon and the Receptionist apologised and said it would be sorted by the time we returned: it wasn’t."
5,the connivence to the tube,rooms were very small and beds uncomfortable
10,The location is excellent. Few minutes walk from Earl's Court Station. The room was fairly big and clean.,Nothing
6,Two mins walk from Earls Court underground and the area felt very safe. it was also only ten to fifteen mins walk to the Natural History Museum.,a little tired round the edges.
6,The second room we got was ok.,The staff is not friendly and they speek poor english.
5,convenient location,"initially offered a room with no window, despite booking a deluxe double."
5,"great location, close to public transport",room was tiny and we had issues with the towels (that were not available) and the room cleanliness
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,the extremely difference between big large room and small room where you cannot move around the bed.
5,location,the room was in the basement and depressing
2,Great location right next to underground station. Well situated,"Had an ‘under ground floor’ room which was exceptionally hot and stuffy. Air conditioner in the room didn’t work making for a very uncomfortable night. Pointless window in the room as the room is underground, just a view on a wall blocking off. Had to unscrew bedside lightbulbs to turn them off as the electrical switches don’t work!
Staff far too formal and borderline rude. Woken up early in the morning due to staff shouting loudly outside the room."
5,the shower was great. the bed was comfy enough. the blackout curtains were great.,too many staff falling over each other doing nothing. I asked in the special comments for a high floor if possible please -got 1 st floor room. asked if possible to have rooms close together- got rooms at opposite ends of building. breakfast again too many staff and only two guys doing any work. one older gentleman doing all the work. last thing the hairdryer was disgusting sticky and dirty.
6,modern and clean,the subterranean rooms
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,The room had floor to ceiling window which directly faced the hotel/reception offices and the room could be looked directly into. Really disappointing.
3,location is convenient,the conditions is not 4 stars to me
6,"Staff at the front desk were friendly and dealt with our queries in a swift manner. The location is great, very close to the Tube and very easy to wander around. It felt like a safe place to stay. The room was clean and very quiet despite facing the street. The windows allow in plenty of light and air when needed. 
I liked that instead of hanging a tag on the door, you simply had a button to say if you needed the room to be cleaned or if you were sleeping.","Breakfast wasn't great - it seemed like the breakfast room was understaffed. Dishes and glasses were piled up on the counter at the back of the room and were left for quite a while on empty tables. Also, the breakfast felt very basic, it wasn't communicated to us that we could request certain things like a type of egg for example - We saw other guests do this. The coffee was awful, like the texture of treacle.
The hotel definitely needs some sprucing up, there are parts of it that are a bit grubby e.g. bannisters on the stairwell and carpets and the dining area (as mentioned above)."
5,situation + nice personnel,down stair with no window! Had I known we would never have booked the hotel!
3,breakfast was good,bedding felt damp

4,"Normal hotel, nothing special.","We were given a room two level below ground, no chances to open windows or get fresh air. 
we stayed for 2 night and for some reason our room was not cleaned the second day. We came back after a long day and had to to the bed since we removed everything to easy the cleaning."

1,Location,"No bath mat caused a serious leg injury, no interest from staff nor apology. Vile and negligent staff"
6,"It’s ok, good location.",When I paid the lady didn’t give me my change and said I will get it when I check out. When I went to check out they didn’t have any. Super weird you don’t get your change when you pay lol.

1 tea bag
No window
Wasn't a luxury bathroom
Wouldn't call it 4 star"

6,"Lovely comfortable bed & good shower, nice to have bottled water left each day","The room we were given hadn't been serviced so we were 'up graded 'to a junior suite, however this seemed very dated with tatty furniture & a sofa that definitely needs replacing carpet & walls marked .Would not rate this room as 4 star boutique hotel."
6,I really liked that they give you water everyday,"First room given was in the basement in the front of the property with no WiFi & couldn't open curtains. Very poor room for the amount paid.

Remade bed with dirty sheets.

Hair underneath bat mat in second room"
6,"We decided to stay in London as we were going to see a show. Found this hotel, ideally located close to the tube and fairly central. 
On check in we found the staff to be very courteous and the lobby clean and tidy with coffee and pastries available. 
They gave us our room key and we were shown to our room. It was only then we realised we were below ground level. 
The room was fine, with a double bed and the bathroom was OK, although the toilet area a little snug, but being below ground there was no point opening the curtains and looking at the legs of the passers by!
Knowing this may have been helpful (if we missed it in the description apologies) but for any future customers, I would ask where your room is.
Other than this, the stay was fine and I must say the staff couldn't do enough for us",Location of the room
1,location,towels were like sandpaper bed was uncomfortable
4,decent location,basement room very poor basic room.
5,the location,"small basement room with small bed.
could hear the drainage system."
3,Good location,"Dirty carpets, uneven floor in the corridors. Cleaner wasn't very thorough. Wardrobe door clashed with bedside cabinet.
Room description was Superior Double, should be standard double."
6,"location for Wembley stadium was perfect, staff couldn’t do enough for you",Areas starting to look poor and repair workmanship is very poor
3,"great location, clean, nice staff","the rating i gave was based purely on the fact that we KNEW we had left some items in the closet, on hangers. because our flight was suddenly changed, we were in a rush and forgot to go through the closet. we realized at the airport and emailed right away. not only did it take them two days to reply, but they denied anything being in there. they were quite expensive pieces of clothing. very unhappy."
6,"Reception staff really nice, bathroom good, nice touches in room for special occasion.",Room very small and dated. Restaurant staff not very friendly. Breakfast very expensive for what you got.
6,"Room and the view were ok, also pretty clean.",Breakfast was very slow and there were not enough tables and waiters. Smell of food in some parts of the hotel.
5,"The restaurante was very nice with good breakfast. It was clean and our room was tended to everyday. It had modern upgrades giving it a good appearance. It was very convenient having Earls Court down the street, underground Rail, and a laundromat was a few doors down.",The room was very small with minimal space to walk around. The bathroom was very small as well with very small bath towels. The shower made a very loud noise when you first turn on the water. The staff were very professional.
1,location good,Terrible noise from the bathroom every 20 minutes overnight that meant very little sleep. 1am staff member came but couldn’t work out why it was happening. The next morning no apology and the admission that this had happened before. I was moved into a new room then had a fight trying to get some compensation for a bad night. No chance and only when pushed offered an upgrade with breakfast. However there is absolutely no way I will ever set foot in that place again.
5,it’s location,lots of electrical faults in the room. loose light fittings. Friendly staff but a lot simply did not understand English properly especially evening staff.

Breakfast was the same every morning. Powdered eggs, sausage, potatoes, little boxes of cereal, a few small danishes. The coffee was either too strong or too weak."
6,"Decent location, rooms were regularly cleaned.","Very small rooms. Upon arrival with my wife, saw 4 employees behind the desk just watch us struggle walking up the stairs with our bags to then have to open the doors and hold them open so that my wife & I could get our bags in. I’m not one to shy away from carrying things, I usually only do 1 trip from the car into my house when I go grocery shopping, but would’ve been nice to at least have one employee open the door for us."
3,Staff were pleasant and polite,"Room was dark and looked out onto a wall, most unpleasant. These rooms are definitely not DELUX. Breakfast very poor. Stairs up to reception dirty."
6,Air conditioning a great bonus during the heatwave.,Room (007) location was poor this was at the rear of the hotel on a lower ground floor with no view. The route to the room incurred several staircases both up and down and ended up using a back service staircase which had very dirty carpets. This spoilt the overall experience of the hotel.
6,"The area was nice, close to the subway and restaurants",The tubs were slippery and I slipped and hurt myself. It was a safety concern.
3,staff location,room 117 was a health and safety issue 2ft x 3ft . had to step into the shower close the door to go to toilet behind open door. room not fit for 2. requested a change and it was arranged next morning no problem.
5,the location was perfect with access to shops and restaurants within walking distance,the shower was very slow and not powerful at all there was very little water coming out. there was no window so we had no natural light or fresh air.
6,the location,"some of the room are literally on the basement, with blind window , not natural light at all. i had to spend my first nigh there, and asked to change the room, room for that i paid 200£/night. the breakfast is poor and bored,"
6,"Indian restaurant within the hotel was very nice as was breakfast.

Location was good for us.",A little overpriced.
6,"location convenient, staff friendly, bed comfortable.","The room, located in lower part of he building, no window, skylight painted to block daylight. Decor dated/tired. Water from
shower drenched bathroom
floor after use. Room was certainly not one from the gallery!!"
6,location was great -staff were helpful and totally lovely.,payment taken out of account before arrival even though it was pay on arrival!
6,The location was excellent as we were attending Wimbledon. The staff were friendly and helpful.,"The carpet and armchair in our room was old and shabby. Our bathroom had a tiny sink and it was right on op of the toilet which had a high disability seat. The drain was very slow to empty in the shower. 
I asked to change rooms but the only option I was shown was much worse. It was smaller and in the basement, very dark and dismal."
2,location,noise. no insulation so could hear everything
6,"Great location near Earl's Court underground station and main road. 
Rooms were very clean. 
The Indian Restaurant was excellent for dinner.","The rooms were very small especially the beds. 
The fridge wasn't keeping our drinks cold. 
Breakfast was OK but small selection of fruits and bread."
4,"The decor was a bit tired, stains on the carpet in outer room","A/C wasn’t terribly good, room was very warm"
5,very friendly staff…they went out of their way to be helpful and welcoming. Beds were very comfortable.,Hotel was a bit tired and needs a refurbishment. Rooms were very small.
10,"Staff went above and beyond. Just lovely kind people, especially Rohan. All staff were great though.",Room was a bit tired in places. Would benefit from a deep clean and upgrade of some furniture.
1,The location is good,"The staff at the reception desk was dishonest. We asked them to call us a Black Cab to go to Heathrow, instead of telling us that Black Cabs not allowed to pick up or drop off people at the hotel, they called an unlicenced hired car to transport us to Heathrow, the driver claimed to be driving a taxi but in fact, after loading our luggage, we realized there was no meter, instead of getting out of the car which we should, the driver persuaded us to stay and told us it is a fixed rate to Heathrow from Park Grand, despite traffic jam, the cost is still 85 pounds, it was 9 pm on a weekday, no traffic, Uber would only charge us 55 pounds and Black Cab 60 pounds. Then upon arrival, this unlicenced driver had no credit card machine, we had to use the QR code to pay which caused us headache because the bank does not like to approve it."
5,Staff very polite and were very helpful.,"The breakfast was not op to par with a 4 star hotel. No finesse in the al a cart.
The tap fittings in the wash area did not have operating instructions. Room 415. Did not have time to discuss with the staff."
4,location,for the money I paid it didn’t include breakfast! 1000 nz dollars and not even a coffee in the morning .. I know londons expensive but for a night at least last min booking throw in breaky
5,it was close to Earl’s Court. it was clean,"bed was very small, bathroom sink made a loud noise every thirty minutes throughout the night. Basic accommodation which was extremely expensive"
3,location,"bathroom too small, rooms not cleaned until 16:00."
6,"breakfast on the second day was very chaotic not enough staff in the breakfast room
two supervisors telling one waiter what to do rather that giving him a hand
all hands to the pump was required",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,The hotel is in a good location. The staff were welcoming and friendly,"The room needs some attention. The walls were marked, there was a light bulb that needed replacing and kept switching on and off. The carpets needed a hoover and there was alot of dust around light fixtures."
6,location was good very close to Earl’s Court station,for £200 a night I expected something better than the basement
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,overpriced rip-off
10,"The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful, the room was very comfortable, there was a lovely breakfast selection, and the hotel was very close to the tube station, so perfect for our brief visit to London.",There was no room for improvement at all - everything was as described/expected or better.
6,"Excellent location with Earls Court tube station within a 3 - 4 minute walking distance. Staff were very pleasant. One in particular by the name of Gurpreet was very quick and helpful about directions and accessing Luton airport from the hotel. Restaurant was spacious and breakfast was good with plenty of choice. The 2nd. morning I made a bad seating choice for breakfast in restaurant - right under an air conditioning unit / not ideal when you're having a ""cooked"" / hot breakfast!","Reception area has a somewhat ""cramped"" feeling about it. Doesn't give a great impression as you enter the hotel, but I guess in these areas of London, space is tight. Similarly, the bedroom I was in / at the very end of corridor on 1st. floor (110 or 112?) was a standard room which I thought was very small. 
There was a persistent background sound in this room when all power was turned off for the night. Couldn't sleep. The hotel was full that 1st. night, so I couldn't move to a different room. However, they did offer me an option to move the following day. When I returned from the event I was attending, they showed me a room in the basement, but this too had exactly the same background noise (when all switches / air con and power was turned off) so I stayed where I was! When I told them at reception that both rooms had the exact same background low humming noise, a lady offered me noise-cancelling headphones. This led me to believe that I wasn't the 1st. person to complain about this (they had lots of these!)"
6,location,"Was not happy to got room without normal window on -1 , but on my request it was changed. Such hotel shouldn't have that room for guests on such price."
6,Staff friendly,"Quality of our first room, cleanliness of the bedding ( stains on the duvet cover), basement room with high window which was close to the ceiling and looked out against a brick wall a metre away
Following a complaint to the manager we were moved to the fifth floor and a better room"
5,Good location for our purposes of the staff were very attentive and friendly,"In certain areas it was a bit tired around the edges. Tired furniture that needs to be replaced. Breakfast, frankly, was very ordinary"
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Room was very small. Breakfast was extremely poor, scrambled eggs were just mush.bacon and sausages lying in grease. I will not pay a service charge for a self service Breakfast!!!
 2 days breakfast for 2 people hotel tried to charge us £12 service charge, No chance. Restaurant apparently is a separate entity from the hotel. Be careful with your hotel bill.

There didnt seem to be a disabled entrance to the hotel. No safety catch on our window on the 4th floor, sash window opened full which is totally unacceptable."
4,"Location,Breakfast.","Room was dirty ,pillows old and raggy , no shower gel in bathroom."
6,Well presented and attentive staff. Great location. Clean lobby.,"Room was on the ground floor and had to walk long distance to get to it. Up and down back stair cases to avoid restaurant. Stairs smelt of damp. Not what we were expecting for a top treated hotel. We had upgraded to a club room, I dread to think what standard room was."
5,location,"size of room, I’m not a large person but to get around other side of bed kept bruising my leg knocking against dressing table"
5,Staff were really friendly,Hotel carpets were dirty room was not clean
6,The restaurant,"There was no anti slip mat in the bath for use with the shower in room 319. I fell on the last morning and have had 3 X-rays for my collar bone 

We were rather stung by our leaving taxi the hotel called for , which was a limo when it arrived Therefore the fare back to Kings Cross Station was £55 the taxi from Kings Cross Sation to the hotel was £25"
1,"location
breakfast was good","room was in a lower basement with no window! double bed was located so that you could only get in from one side 
Breakfast room staff were rude and unhelpful
Bar was closed at 10pm including room service"
6,Location and clean.,Smell of the bed linen and Dinner menu heavily orientated to Indian food. Would also have preferred a separate area for ore-dinner drink.
3,fire alarm went off,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,The location is amazing. Close to everything.,"We have stayed in this hotel for the second time and probably the last.

We were offered an “upgraded” room which was located in the basement. There was a bad damp smell. There was a mold on shower door. The upgrade referred to its size but to be honest I would much prefer a smaller room with windows facing street than windows facing the back of the building where all the air conditioning fan systems are located. 

One more thing. To get to the room you need to pass four flight of stairs two going up and two going down. No lift."
5,bed was large and comfortable,thought it was overpriced. very average place. old.
6,"Breakfast was exceptional, room fairly comfortable","Room too small, we booked a deluxe double room but the room definitely didn't match the picture on your site, too far out, it also said on your side that it was 0.2miles from the Royal Albert Hall but it was considerably further than that, pillows not thick enough"
2,the room was nice and clean,the staff were rude & refused to let me into the restaurant even when it was free. This was during mid day. I was advised that they were busy even though the restaurant was free.
5,Extremely friendly and helpful staff. I was able to (slightly) open a door to a balcony to get fresh air into the room.,"Room was aging (examples: a broken towel rail behind the bathroom door, water did not drain well from the shower, the room looked out onto a dirty balcony with what looked like old building rubbish left on it.)"
4,Staff absolutely brilliant very helpful friendly,"Room very very dated scum marks in shower area furniture dated scratched
I paid for deluxe room Would have been better in Premier inn"
6,Location,Noise and room size
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,WiFi. No English breakfast tea bags left. When i arrived and again the next day had to ask for them. Room small for the money.
6,"Clean room
Lovely toiletries
Staff nice
Comfy bed","Window wouldn't open
Fridge not working
Wouldn't class the room as superior
Air conditioning was poor"
6,Very close to the station and a short walk to the Natural History Museum and V&A. Room was clean and bed was comfortable.,The room was in the basement and did not have any windows- would have liked to know this beforehand. Corridors were a little noisy at night time- we had someone ringing the doorbell to our room late at night.
6,"Staff were exceptional. Very friendly, nice demeanor and very obliging. This is a big benefit. 
The room was very clean. TV/ wI-fi very good - all worked well. Tea / kettle in the room all a benefit and availability at reception during the day. Location near to Earls Court tube station.","The hotel was a little worn and felt dingy in the corridors and stairway. Paintwork and carpets could do with a refresh. Room was tiny and a little dingy. All clean and well laid out to maximize the space. Very noisy, it was very windy and the wind felt like it was coming in through the windows. Gym ok but elliptical machine was not working. Again, space a little dingy but had decent equipment for a London gym. Duvet was not fluffy, it was not a typical hotle duvet filing although white bedding was spotlessly clean and fresh. I think the location ‘Kensington’ is a little misleading as it’s really Earls Court. Hard to get black cab, as Uber app not functioning so had to take private car to airport as I had a lot of luggage."
5,"Good location, room was clean and due to it being Saturday night I could park right outside on the road.","Paid for to stay in a Deluxe room yet it below ground, with a very little amount of natural light and did not seem that big at all. The shower drain was clearly blocked as water filled and over ran the shower quickly. Very poor value for money."
6,"It was just okay, nothing special.","The rooms are small
The internet was terrible unfortunately."
5,Room was comfy and bathroom very high quality. Bedding and towels good quality. Location good and well located for tube station.,Did not match with the excellent reviews on here and trip advisor. Overall hotel was tired. Lift was filthy. Breakfasts disappointing.
5,"It was obvious that carpet wasn’t hoovered, tu under the the bedside table and crumbs around the bed. Bathroom had shower which wasn’t descaled and clean properly in a long time. They were black moulds mark around tab and doors on shower from inside were having mould too , every time you run shower this mould from doors would come out. You should really deep clean shower cubicles and tiles with descaled and toothbrush! Very disappointed!",Dirt around bed and mouldy shower cubicle
6,Clean and central. Great location. Help from the staff to carry luggage when lift wasn't working. Received complimentary breakfast first morning to compensate for inconvenience of checking in process. Breakfast was delicious. Plenty of power outlets in room.,"The hotel did not have our booking on arrival, even though Booking confirmed later that they had in fact transmitted the booking. They said it would take a few minutes (5)
 to prepare a room for us, but it took much longer (an hour). The WiFi didn't work properly so we used the hotel next door for WiFi. The lift was often out of order (and we were located on the fourth floor). On the final day, housekeeping didn't leave any clean large towels. We called immediately to request 3 towels and only got two, we asked again at reception and finally someone came up with a sheet(!) We kept waiting for him to return with the requested towel but remained without. We brought this to staff's attention at checkout and they were apologetic."
3,Room was comfortable and clean.,"WiFi, was slow and weak, intermittent. This really overshadows everything else.

Room service food menu was extremely disappointing.

The barman didn't what a Kir Royale was, could not offer champagne by the glass."
5,great location,not what I expected for the price - room was very hidden away; very noisy
5,"location, staff were nice",room in basement
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Room in basement , dark need a better lighting !"
6,Comfy bed and great shower/bath. Good location,We had a basement room with a window but no natural light which was disorienting. Very dark and was hard to get a comfortable temperature in the room.
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Windowless room. Room was not good value for money
6,Convenient for Earl’s Court tube station. Comfortable bed.,"Supposedly we were ’upgraded’ and our new room was ‘downstairs’ - is that OK? Well as we had never been here before couldn’t really have an opinion. Downstairs meant the basement. Via a maze of corridors, stairs down, steps up and stairs down, stained carpets, staff quarters with their doors open, we finally arrived at our room. The size of room was probably an ‘upgrade’ but I think I would have preferred a smaller one that wasn’t ‘downstairs’. There were patio doors onto a small square patio surrounded by concrete, with old plant pots and rubbish thrown from above. The curtains were closed, so room was dark. Someone was speaking on their phone in the room above and we could hear the conversation. The room was COLD (it was 3C outside and a cold wind). We checked the thermostat and put it to 27C. Asked at reception and they confirmed the heating was now on. We went out for the evening and when we came back it didn’t seem any warmer. The TV was put on next door and we could listen to the movie clearly! Wifi dropped out all the time if you could get on it."
6,"clean, modern and comfortable","tv was disgraceful. 6 channels only, none of the standard Bbc or itv. bar was shut when ingot back at 1040pm, disappointing
quite small room. shower basin did not empty, was standing in a lot of water"
10,the staff and the location. the quality price is fantastic.,it a little bit old and the bed is not comfortable.

6,Location was good. Quiet road near to shops and station,The room was in the basement with no natural light.
6,It was very clean and the amenities were very good! Was also in a decent location too.,The room was on the basement level so lack of natural light.
4,the food from the restaurant is delicious and reasonably priced. The room is v clean and the bathroom is nice. The room is cosy too. The food was genuinely the best thing and the guys in the restaurant work super hard and are lovely and helpful.,"the internet is terrible, I couldn't even access my 4G in the room. They are clearly aware of the issue as they said if I had told them during my stay that I could get another internet log on. However, given this is a room to cater for business clients how they expect that with no and or poor internet is unacceptable. I was quite annoyed by that and also the level of noise in the street- be careful on the room selection as I had a lorry cleaning the drains lousy from 7am and also the rooms have limited noise insulation so you hear every door in the corridor slam."
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,rooms were freezing cold.
5,The staff,"Despite the nice gesture of having our room ""upgraded"", the wooden furniture was pretty old fashioned and had certainly seen better days. For a 4 star hotel, in this day and age - you'd expect a bit better. The water pressure in the shower is below-par, to say the least. The TV in the room also needs to be updated - we are in 2022 - not 2007. The internet quality is woeful - constantly dropping in and out! Definitely not a 4 star hotel. More of a mediocre 3 star hotel. The W14 Hotel is a better hotel - also better value for money, as it is usually cheaper over there. Overall the hotel is massively overrated - and the positive reviews we read before booking the hotel certainly led us to believe we were actually going to a 4 star hotel. The only main positive was the staff, as they were excellent and very friendly!"
6,"Room was very clean and spacious. 
Food in restaurant was gorgeous. 
Staff were also very nice",We were staying in one of the rooms which seemed to be based down in the basement floor where the kitchen area was. This part of the hotel seemed a bit grubby compared to the rest as the carpet was pretty worn and a strong smell of smoke. There were a few flights of narrow stairs to go down which wasn’t ideal with heavy bags. The room was also a bit confusing to find! The room itself was lovely and I couldn’t fault it at all.
5,shower was nice. lovely make up mirror.,"Room too small, bed too small. No water provided until I asked when we got up."
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"The room wasnt cleaned properly, we found leftover food on the floor at the bottom of the bed - chips. I did speak to reception who offered me a bottle of water to compensate. Fortunately we were just using the room for a bed as we were out all day and evening."

10,"Excellent service and staff. 
I will recommend the hotel to everyone.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,it was clean and I guess good for the price,"it seems if you book via an external site I.e booking.com you get the basement rooms which are a fair way from reception, base floor and you feel the temperature drop as you go down from the upper level!"
10,"We visited for a birthday celebration, and the team at the hotel went above and beyond to make the stay a memorable one. They decorated the bedroom with balloons and even a slice of cake and whenever they saw us they went out of their way to check we was happy. 

This to me just shows how important customers are to this team and it really was lovely to see.",N/A

I had asked the hotel before arriving if they could have a dessert of some sort in the room for when we arrived for my partners 30th Birthday and they had put balloons, a dessert, a birthday cake made out of towels(really cool),rose petals on the bed and some chocolates which was really amazing !!!",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.

2,Good location,"Windowless basement room was like a cell! Staff were cold and unfriendly. Asked us to pay when checking in and out, despite us having already paid in full 2 days prior to arrival. This miserable hotel really spoilt our otherwise amazing trip to London."

Mix up with rooms as I had cancelled the room I first booked with booking.com.This seemed to annoy the receptionist. Room was small, hot, no air conditioning. Wasn't worth the money. Won't be staying again. Not sure what room I ended up with but I've had better for less money on previous occasions."
1,Nothing,Very unimpressed with their attitude
3,The location is good,"the rooms are disgusting there are a lot of rooms underground that get ZERO natural light, and this is something they dont declare. There were also loads of weird stains across the room on the walls, also dead flies in the toilet and the entire hotel smelt dreadful."
2,How close the underground is to the hotel. How quickly we got a new room after complaining.,"The carpets in the corridor looks ruined like it’s been soaked.

6,It's conveniently located right by the underground station and within walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall.,"The soundproofing is poor. You can hear hallway conversations, construction work outside, and traffic noise. While the bed was clean and comfortable, the rest of the room was not thoroughly cleaned. The bottoms of the curtains were brown, and the shower was covered in mold. Although the room directory promised 24-hour access to hot and cold beverages, we were told that drinking water was unavailable past 10pm due to the restaurant being closed, and we were directed to the nearest shop instead."
5,Much antiquate furnishing and musky smell,Location
5,Location was good for us getting to Wimbledon.,Room was in the basement and there was a smell of damp that all the plug in air fresheners could hide. View was window was a brick wall. Had breakfast in first morning and it was below use. Tea was Luke warm.

3,The location is brillant for london,"Accomodation for 3 is not a double and a cot bed in an apparently deluxe triple room 
Breakfast some of the food looked like it had seen better days 
You definately need to take the word grand out of your title"
6,The location was good and the hotel staff was also very good.,"The rooms were very “tired” - aged carpets, scratched furniture, showers were not clean night to feel hygienic. Black mould in places etc - overall the place needs deep clean / update."
6,Location was ideal for a visit to the Royal Albert Hall. Air conditioning was good and room was quiet.,Bed was a standard double. Expect a king-size for the price. Wardrobe doors were difficult and noisy to use. Bathroom sink unit was in a poor state of repair. Lighting in bedroom limited. Overpriced for what we got.
3,Location,"Tired, dated and in need of renovation. Complained about first room, dead bird outside window, wallpaper pealing off, faulty fridge. Moved rooms, slightly better condition but still poor. Not worth the money, would not recommend. Staff disinterested."
6,Convenient,Needed a good clean. The fridge in the room didn’t have anything in it not even cold water. Air conditioning was awful and didn’t really work.
5,"Quick check in/ check out. They had a gym, not great but hey it's something.","Outdated hotel with not that much better pricing than much better comparisons.
Outdated appliances throughout. Tiny fridge with no mini bar. Denied room service for no apparent reason, when sick and it was advertised. .
More assistance from staff would be good."
6,The location was fabulous,"Booked a double room only to find it was 2 single beds pushed together and made separately, didn't complain about that seeing as it was only 3 nights, but it wasn't explained to us at reception that was what we were getting. No Complimentary water as stated from hotel, not enough complimentary tea bags, sugar and milk."
5,Location of the hotel was just perfect for what we were doing at the weekend,"Rooms were quite dated, cleanliness was not a high standard. Called the day before to request the room to be decorated for a special birthday an this was missed. Parents safe and TV was not working in their room over the weekend and was not resolved"
6,Location and staff were wonderful. Breakfast was good. We had some issues with our initial room and the staff was kind and moved us to a different room which was slightly better than the first.,Very old and worn furnishings. The beds were the most uncomfortable I’ve ever slept in. We had three rooms between our group and we all slept terribly while we were there. When you lay down you sink to the middle and then get a back full of springs. The cloth on the outside of the box springs was torn in multiple places. Holes worn into the carpet. Mold and mildew growing in the shower and bathroom ceiling. The air broke midway through our stay. They eventually got it fixed after we asked them a couple of times. It broke in our kids room too but my kids never said anything to us so we didn’t know about it until the day we checked out. This place needs a complete furniture and carpet overhaul and the bathrooms need a good amount of bleach.
2,Location,"Room had not been cleaned and was in basement, did change room but was not clean and air conditioning did not work."
5,"Breakfast not included but adequate for extra price charged. 
Room too small and no bottled water supplied as annotated in the guest information booklet in the room! 
We were told check out time was 11am, again despite the in room booklet stating 12am!?
NB. If the hotel changes the rules/guest information they should at least amend the guest information booklet as a fundamental courtesy too preclude embarrassment to guests and staff alike!",See above commentary!
3,Breakfast ok and location was v. Good.,"Room was serviced poorly, eg beds were not made up properly and used glasses not cleaned or replaced."
4,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"The hotel was tired and grubby in parts, a little care and attention to detail is necessary. Frayed carpets, badly sewn holes in net curtains and cracked mirrors create a negative image for the hotel. 
My television didn’t work, the night staff were great and tried to fix it but to no avail, I was offered a breakfast as compensation."
6,Good location close to Earls Court station.,"A bit of a run down property. Odd odours in the hallways, windows that didn't entirely close letting street noise through, stained carpet and curtains... I can generally look past that sort of thing, but especially for this price (almost 200 pounds per night without breakfast) I had expected something very different."
4,Staff were helpful,Breakfast was poor compared to other 4* hotels we have stayed in. Room very small. Decor in restaurant & corridors was ‘tired’.
3,Location.,"Checked into room. Tea tray had been used, dirty and not replenished. Shower tray had someone's old razor head in it. Asked 3 times for it to be removed and never was! Housekeeping never replaced biscuits in room. Carpets worn and tired. No shower gel only shampoo. Slow lift and dirty."
4,"The rooms were comfortable and clean.
The location was close to the underground",The public spaces looked grubby and in need of an upgrade..There was no comfortable bar as such only a few tall stools at the bar itself...guests were expected to drink at the dining tables.
5,Good location,Beds too soft. Air con broken and room very warm
1,Absolutely nothing - dreadful - staff were unfriendly and never smile or say hello.,Everything! When we arrived at the hotel nobody said hello and welcome - not one single word - just looked at us for us to speak - absolutely awful customer service. The bedroom which was supposed to be luxury was shocking and very small for 3 people. Breakfast was very poor and the welcome we received in the restaurant was shocking almost like they didn't want us there.
2,Nice staff. air-conditioning worked.,"Mold across wall in bedroom below the window. Deadly shower -extremely slippery. Shower knobs all missing pieces. Teeny tiny room. TV never had reception - we had 5 total channels - staff kept blaming rain even though it hasn't rained for a few days. Bathroom vent kept turning on randomly throughout the stay, day and night, just for a quick 3 seconds each time. Hallways were dense with scent, likely to cover another smell like mold."
6,Location- very handy for Earl's Court Station.,"Receptionist - not very welcoming.
Room - Superior Double, barely enough room to swing a cat!"
5,Breakfast was included in the price and was good. The hotel was located on a quiet street which kept noise at a minimum. The room was clean.,The hotel in general is tired. The room was on the small side.
3,"First room on 5th floor was foisty and barely large enough for 1 person let alone 2 ! Receptionist tried to kid us they had upgraded our room lol ,They kindly moved us to a 'normal' room that was ok, dated but ok.","Very expensive for such a dated old fashioned hotel, no British staff so not easy to communicate with unfortunately ."
2,Nothing...,"Breakfast was awful.....
Not a full English at all.

Very dirty rooms. Far too small and the shower was pathetic.

Never ever would I this again"
5,"room location was ok 
meal in resturant was good",breakfeast was allwrite only quorn sossages no meat ones
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Breakfast was miserable with cold, congealed food. Rooms are small and smell of old cigarette smoke. Not worth the hefty price tag!"
5,Good room facilities,Room wasn’t cleaned for the two nights we stayed … bins not emptied and sanitary waste not removed… for the money we spent the room looked nothing like the pics with nice bed throws etc on ….
6,Location was very handy for all things with the tube station just a 3 minute walk away.,Very small rooms with basic facilities. Staff all friendly
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Unfortunately we didn’t have a useable window in our room, which made spending time there uncomfortable"
2,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Free upgrade to the basement. No hot water. Staff very rude.
3,"The room we ended up gettin was better than the initial room, the location was also good.","The first night we came back to the hotel around 1/2am after an amazing evening out to find there was no electricity on the floor our room was situated. We were told the only option is to move rooms baring in mind it’s 2am. receptionist said he and other staff members would help move our things but no one helped. We had to pack our belongings and carry our suitcases, clothes etc on hangers up the stairs to reception, then from there get the lift up to our new floor. This completely ruined our night. We then woke up and the electricity and water had been turned off in our new room, we spoke to reception and they said there was nothing they could do “there was a leak and the were waiting on a plumber” We spent our first full day around London without showering or even being able to get ready! Again this ruined our day no support was offered no additional water was given to wash our faces or brush our teeth, nothing at all! After leaving we realised we left our iron in the first room as there was no lights and we couldn’t see, we tried calling the property and the number doesn’t work, we rang other park grand and they said they are no longer part of our group. Over all paid a massive £360 for a horrendous two night stay."
4,"It was ok, definitely not a 4 star in my opinion","The room was noisy and very hot, air con was non existent, breakfast was terrible and area very small. Very bad customer service."
5,Bit disappointed with our stay - didn’t feel like a 4 star hotel,"Provided the following information via email after being asked for feedback but got no reply after our stay in Feb 2024. 
We requested more pillows as the ones we had were very flat.
At the same time we also asked for blankets as the room was really cold and despite turning the heating up over an hour later we were still cold. We waited and waited and had to call reception again regarding this and were advised no blankets but extra duvets were delivered instead - this helped but shouldn’t have had to ask twice as this was embarrassing.
There were 3 of us staying in the room and only 2 teabags provided, again had to ask twice for these despite asking at the same time as the blankets. Need to provide adequate supplies for at least 2 drinks per person per night.
The lights in the room were a little confusing as there was a long delay turning them on, even the porter wasn’t sure when first showing us to our room. We had difficulty turning the bedside lights off in the evening none of the bedside switches seemed to work, turned them off at the door. We were too embarrassed to contact reception again as after the second call we didn’t feel comfortable doing so.
Even though there is a microwave in the room - there is no cutlery or crockery if we were to have used it."
5,Location near tube station.,Room very small. Not as clean as expected.
3,"Location was excellent. Really easy walk from tube station 
Breakfast was good quality. Nicely preset, with plenty of choice. Pleasant dining room","Room was smaller than expected, hot and noisy. Air conditioning didn't work. Room description misleading. It mentioned water, cookies, bathrobes, slippers and wine in the room. There was water and cookies on the first night but these were not replenished the next day. Reception staff could not explain why this was the policy, when both nights were charged at the same rate. Bathrobes, slippers and wine were not supplied at all. We hung up towels to Indicate we would re-use them, as requested on a card in the bathroom. Towels were replaced with new and the soap was replaced by a new, wrapped, bar - very wasteful."
4,The location,"Staff were not pleasant, no effort to make small talk. When we checked out they did not ask us about our stay.
The property was cold. We stayed downstairs in the basement and we had to ask for an extra duvet. Poor placement of heating unit over the wardrobe which meant the room didn’t heat up.
Corridors smelt musty. Someone had spilt soup or something on the carpet and it was not cleaned up over the 3 days we were there. Windows and outside courtyard needed a clean off the bedroom.
Hotel needs updating. New carpets on stairs and hallways definitely needed. 
Poor attention to detail. There was a letter in the room in the Welcome Book about a fire drill in August 2023. Issue with the tv, faded strip appearing on the bottom of the screen in room 14."
6,Location was ok,Cleanliness outside hotel room on patio area. New room provided which was in the basement with no windows
3,Room was clean & comfortable. Convenient location for the underground. Staff polite.,"Room had no natural light, just a window with closed curtains with a wall behind the glass with a florescent tube above as light - like sleeping in a dungeon, waking up all the time to check the time - dreadful! We were also told we had been upgraded to bigger rooms so I dread to think what the smaller ones were like!
Room had a nice looking TV but no remote control, so useless (daughters room the same & nothing in the info file to say anything re the TV). Lights by the side of the bed - took 5 minutes to find out how to turn them off - not just me but my daughter had the room next to me & said she had the same issue.
Breakfast - included in the exorbitant price (over £250/room) - undrinkable tea, coffee & orange juice (made from concentrate), cheap, generic cereals, same for the bread & under ripe fruit. Waste of money."
1,Nothing,The water pressure in the downstairs rooms is very very low in fact it’s a trickle. The Hotel is noisy. The milk in the little pots for making tea was off. According to the manager because I didn’t bring this to their attention immediately I am making it up.
6,Noisy outside room - sounded like aircon or extractor fan.,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,The convenient location,AC wasn’t working . It too hot to stay during the day in the room. Bathroom fittings were broken .
4,"Location is great, about 2 minutes walk to Earls Court Tube
Station with direct trains to Heathrow
The doorman Sam was just fantastic, he was so cheerful a
is a real asset to the hotel.
We were moved to a quieter room thanks to the very nice
maintenance man, no questions asked he just moved us immediately","I think all the other staff could do with some training in
customer service. I think it's totally unacceptable that staff are
on their phones at reception
The staff in the dining room have obviously received no training
we basically felt we were just an inconvenience when going in
for breakfast, constantly had to ask for tea and coffee, the
tables were not cleared quickly enough and when we were
asked for our room number there was no good morning or even
eye contact, basic requirements I think
The breakfast offering was not fantastic and on 2 mornings it
was served from a much smaller area, not acceptable.
On checking out the question was asked if we enjoyed our stay,
again with absolutely no interest or enthusiasm, I replied it was
OK, yet again no question as to why it was just OK!
This was a birthday treat but it certainly didn't feel like that, I
work in the service industry and the level of customer service
left a lot to be desired. No visible sign of a hotel manager
during our stay. We stayed at the hotel some years ago, it is a little tired."
1,"Location is great, 5 mins walk to Earls Court Tube Station. Beds werw comfy. Able to leave bags after checking out. Reception and concierge staff were friendly.","The original room we were allocated to (120) had a musty smell and an awful lot of mould around the window. I complained and was moved to a club room (209) which was a larger room than the original one we booked, however is wasn't much better, the insides of the shower screen and the shower tracks were filthy dirty. I have stayed here previously but felt that it has gone downhill and rooms are in need of a refurb. I wouldn't stay again."
6,"I booked 2 rooms for family members and myself and although the rooms were small mine was fine. The other room has a strong smell of weed when you walked in (I think coming from the vent above the bathroom door), it was also quite noisy from some building work being carried out, which I think is also where the weed smell was coming from. The bed in the other room was also a little odd. The base of the bed was bigger than the mattress meaning it stuck out and was easy to hit your leg on when you walked past. The breakfast included in the price was much better than I was expecting, and much more comprehensive. Staff on the whole were friendly and nice, except the one front desk person who when my sister reported a broken glass in the elevator to asked her a number of interrogating type questions and then didn't even clean it up.",Was a bit of outside noise but this was mainly caused by one very load Romanian family who didn't know how to talk to each other and literally screamed at each other despite being just metres away. Also a staff member at breakfast broke a glass and then took forever to clean it up. She even kicked a very large piece accidentally under our table but didn't bother to clean it until we asked her too (she saw that she had kicked it too).
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"The room was not clean 
I booked a double bed and it was two singles pushed together which kept separating and was very uncomfortable . The window had no handles on them and it was broken I was told this was an upgrade but it was definitely not.."
4,Can’t think of anything.,Room with 2 windows that looked at wall. Scuffed services. Elongated room which made furniture look strange in setting.
4,Certain member of staff were attentive.,The breakfast staff & staff in the Indian themed restaurant were rude & not attentive to guests. On 2 separate occasions our tea & coffee order was incorrect when asked for it to be corrected we were met with an attitude. The room itself needed a deep clean. Heavy dust on all furniture the side of the bath between the hand basin & bath panel was dirty. Underneath needed a severe hoovering we advised the cleaning staff but nothing had been done even complaining to the reception staff we were met by a dumbfounded look &negative response. We were situated on the 3rd floor there was water coming through the ceiling which resulted in the ceiling paint flaking away into the floor it was never hoovered. On our last day there was an instant smell of cannabis use & the hotel was noisy late at night & early morning. Bearing in mind this is a 4 star hotel which needs immediate tlc. It was not cheap to stay at this hotel I would expect to find these sorts of issues in a hostel. I've had better stays at a premier inn & travelodge. I will not return again.
2,Location was good and rooms were tended daily.,Staff appeared to not want to be bothered. Had to ask for coffee in restaurant after being ignored for ten minutes. There was mold in the shower in one room. We were put on a lower level with no windows. There were skylights but they were so covered in filth that little light came through. Air fresheners were used in the hallway to mask the mildew smell.
6,Th staff were really great and the room was very clean.,There was a noise coming from the bathroom that kept waking us up through the night.
5,Close to tube and helpful and friendly staff,"Bed was extremely uncomfortable, needed a new mattress and room was quite dirty in terms of stains and marks on wall and black mould in bathroom"
6,"Very friendly staff, I even got an upgrade to a bigger room","The room wasn't entirely clean. There were pastry crumbs on the armchair and small sofa. Probably a one off mistake, as the hotel seems to have rather good reviews! The bathroom was quite cold too. I had to make sure to keep it closed at all times so that the rest of the room doesn't get too cold."
4,"Location, Breakfast v. good,","Problems within the room, broken towel rail - towels kept falling on floor, 
Dust on shelving in wardrobe - underside of clothes covered in dust, 
Water running down inside of window - carpet wet and damp smelling 
Black mould all round bottom of shower cubicle
4 inch gap between bed mattress and headboard meaning pillow kept falling down gap
Bar shut at 9.30 pm
Automatic door lock to room failed - waited 20mins to get into room at 10.30 pm"
1,The entrance,Inside dated and furniture all worn and scuffed. Bed sheets had stains on them
5,The breakfast was good and the location of the hotel was good.,I had no hot water pressure so could not take a hot shower for 2 days. After the first day I was told it would be fixed and it wasnt. When chatting at reception upon check out they said it is because everyone showers in the morning. If I am paying for a hotel room I expect it to come hot water to be able to shower no matter the time of the day or how many people are showering at that moment.
5,"Great location, right beside tube statuon",Inability to leave luggage after checkout and collect later. General amenities in room
4,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of staying at the Park Grand London Kensington, and I must say it left much to be desired. Here’s my candid review:

Location and Amenities
The hotel’s location, just 150 meters from Earls Court Tube Station, is indeed convenient. However, the promised amenities fell short. The rooms were far from what I’d call stylish—a disappointment right from the start. And let’s talk about the bathroom: it was tiny, lacking any semblance of comfort. To make matters worse, there were no fans to alleviate the stuffiness.

Elevator Ordeal: A Missed Opportunity
Now, brace yourself for the most frustrating part: the elevator situation. Upon arrival, I was informed that the lift was out of order. Fine, I thought—I can handle stairs. But carrying my bags up five flights without any assistance was a letdown. And guess what? Later, I discovered there was a service elevator, tantalizingly close yet strictly off-limits to guests. The lack of consistency and communication was infuriating.

Staff Interaction: Hit or Miss
The staff—well, it was a mixed bag. Some were friendly and helpful, while others seemed indifferent. Consistency matters, especially when you’re paying for a comfortable stay.
Recommendations (or Lack Thereof)
Despite the disappointments, the Park Grand London Kensington has potential. But management needs to step up their game. Address the communication gaps, fix the elevator debacle, and perhaps invest in room upgrades. A little extra effort in customer service can go a long way.

Final Verdict: Proceed with Caution
In summary, my stay at Park Grand London Kensington was like riding a rollercoaster—ups and downs, but mostly downs. If you can overlook the flaws, the convenient location might still sway you. But approach with caution.
Remember, this review reflects my personal experience, and yours may differ. Safe travels, and may your next hotel stay be smoother! 🌟"
2,Checking out,This hotel is dirty and simply ignores the basic fundamentals of running a hotel.
5,"The position was great, a short walk to earl's court. In the area there were many restaurants, fast food and small markets.","First: no other drinks other than juices, plain tea or coffee were included. So you had to pay an additional fee if you wanted a cappuccino (never in my life I experienced a 4 star hotel doind this)
Also, on the last day we left at 6. As breakfast start at 7 we asked if we could still get something to eat before leaving as the breakfast was PAID. They didn't give us anything, but of course kept the money.. Honestly disappoing for a 4 stars.
The most outragious thing was THE ELEVATOR BROKE AND REMAINED OUT OF ORDER FOR OUR WHOLE STAY! that ment carrying two very big suitcases for four floors! They didn't offer any help al all.
Also, no smart tv. Only english channels. Again, disappoining for a 4 stars hotel.
Over all, not worth the money."
3,The bed was soft and the linen was clean.,"The shower had signs of mould, especially on the overhead shower which I rubbed away some of with a towel. The paint and maintenance of the property is poor. Sadly the room was musty and a bit weird."
4,The location is fabulous literally 2 mins walk from Earls Court Tube Station. Great for bars/restaurants and a co op.,"It definitely wasn't a 4 star. Room was dirty especially the bathroom, mould all down the side of the sink/shower. Inside the shower was black mould. Hair was left in shower tray, obviously from previous guest. Along the skirting was filthy. It looked like it needed a complete deep clean! There was nowhere to put toiletries the side of the sink was way too small. Dressing Table wasn't clean at the side, something had been spilt but not cleaned up after. Breakfast was very basic, not much choice. No salt/pepper pots just satchets which you got yourself. No eggs other than scrambled. Not much choice of fruit, cereal or cooked breakfast. Bar wasn't open for residents at night, which for a 4 star I'd of thought it would be. The lift broke so there was no alternative so we had to use the stairs with our cases to the 3rd floor! There wasn't anybody offering to help with luggage up/down the stairs, especially for those who are elderly. When I mentioned on check out about the dirty bathroom, receptionist wasn't bothered it obviously went in one ear out the other. 
Very sad it's not up to a 4 star standard as its in a lovely street, and such a great location! Please sort your housekeeping out very poor!"
2,Location,"Noisy, poor beds and bedding, terrible breakfast"
4,"We had to change room , first room was cold and damp changed to better room a bigger bed Lights rooms very poor all lights on walls couldn’t see into wardrobes.all's my wife lost a pair of rather expenceive shoes we asked reception to look for them couldn’t find them we were in the only a couple hours the was a hairbrush aswell",Non Improve the breakfast bedrooms. Brithen the rooms up
6,Super close to the metro,"Cold room, we felt the wind from outside. The bath mat had hairs…"
5,"The staff were friendly, good location.",The place smelt of damp and could do with renovating.
4,Location,"Dated, very small rooms and beds"
5,room size and hotel location.,"breakfast was poor, food was over cooked and tasteless. if I was to consider a return, I would not plan to eat at the hotel."
6,Breakfast was good and check in/out was easy. Fabulous view from the window.,The staff’s attitudes weren’t great when we first checked in. There was a very unpleasant smell in the hallway on our floor when we checked in and no hot water for a few hours in the evening due to an issue. No information given on this until we chased it and no compensation for the issue
5,It was close to the Earl’s court station which made it easy to join the city center,"It absolutely wasn’t worth the price nor is it worth the 5 stars… the cleaning was okay but there was a lot of dust which is unacceptable for such a hotel. We paid for breakfast and had the surprise that if you wanted a hot drink ( other than coffee ) you had to pay ! Very disappointed, we won’t be back."
4,It is at a good location,Heating was not switched on even after two calls to reception. Mattress dips down so much that you can feel how old it is. Unfortunately didn’t took shower because of hairs already there. If you are staying in a room numbered with a single digit then you will have to walk through several steps down in the basement and you will see old carpet and a smell
6,Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. Small room.,Strange route to get to the room - had to go up to the first floor and then down again. The corridor areas were quite shabby and in need of redecoration.
1,Nothing,No electrics
6,Staff were lovely. Breakfast was plentiful (cooked foods weren’t brilliant quality) but plenty of choice.,Bathroom filthy and facilities broken. Towels were ooor quality. Bed sheets were too big for duvet (duvet was a single on a double bed?!).
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,There was no onsite parking. male staff member was very rude said we needed photo I.d even though it didn’t state this when booking and said we would have to get some in order to stay at the hotel. Tv remote only part working and side lights wouldn’t turn off
5,Breakfast was fine. Decent location. Room was reasonably clean.,"Decor very tired. Was offered an upgrade at no extra cost when checking in, but if the upgraded room was an ""upgrade"", then I would not like to see the ""superior"" rooms we had booked."
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Arrived to discover that they do not hold your bag pre or post check out which was really inconvenient
4,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Plumbing loud
5,Nothing,"Everything. Tiny rooms, unfriendly staff"
4,Location was excellent for what we required,Not very clean
4,It was close to ti e station,We were given an ‘upgrade’ which was a basement too without windows.
2,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Paid for a triple room 3 adults and got double with small camp bed.
2 cups 2 glasses. Shocking."
5,After being moved bed was comfortable.,"No storage of cases while waiting for room to be ready. Lots of guests were annoyed - had to wait 2 hours til room was ready - wasted time! Advised rules changed on this yesterday by printed note on counter. But guests told various time frames 1 week ago, 2 weeks ago! Disgraceful service staff couldn’t care less about their guests. 
Friends luggage sitting close to window - clothes on top soaking after a rainy night - told it was condensation. There was gaffer tape on window!!!! Why !!!! Didn’t care when told friends clothing was wet. 
Front desk service was non existent. We were blamed for our room not being ready because in comments I’d asked for a quiet room! Didn’t get one on front street.
Hotel is Not in Kensington it’s Earls Court - big difference - stayed in Kensington 3 times quality service quality hotels Park Grand needs booking.com looking into hotel and the way it’s run more closely. So so disappointed."
5,The rooms were really convenient and the location perfect!,"It was unacceptable that in this price they didn’t offer luggage storage for our suitcases and we had to leave them in the entrance without proper safekeeping! Also, although we asked for the manager he never appeared and the staff in the reception didn’t even seem concerned or eager to help! 
This is my first time after travelling more than 15 years for both professional and personal reasons that a hotel that I have been staying doesn’t offer luggage storage for suitcases. This was unacceptable and I would certainly not stay again in the hotel for that reason!"
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Small bed awful pillows condensation running down the walls . Rubbish breakfast
6,Proximity to the Underground,"Internet was poor. Signal was speedy and accessible only at the door of the room. Move to the actual bed area or desk, the signal dropped off tremendously to the point when one couldn’t access text nor email.

I had to ask three times on different days to get extra blankets for each twin bed"
3,Location - close to the underground,Some staff were grumpy and unfriendly. Breakfast was poor - poor choice and quality.
4,Shower and service in restaurant,"Too small room for two people, cleaner knocked at the door waking us up asking if required cleaning services."
5,The location,The price against overall quality
3,Breakfast was ok,Room not clean
6,Great location - Close to Earls Court tube.,Various issues. I have submitted an e-mail direct to Park Grand. Disappointed . Doesn't warrant the 4* rating that it has.
5,"Mattress was very comfortable. 
Shower was good.","Dirty in places . 
Small compact room
Needs some cosmetic attention."
6,"The location of the hotel is excellent. 20 second walk to tube station and plenty of restaurants and bars in walking distance. The area was quiet too apart from the occasional rubbish truck.

Staff was very pleasant.","The room was very small for the price. The walls are quite thin too as you could hear every bit of movement in the corridors from your room. 

Bit expensive for what it is. 

Coffee wasn't included in the breakfast so I had to pay extra for hot drinks"
6,The location,poor breakfast. there should be a coffee machine within easy reach of customers. For a latte or cappuccino you have to pay extra.
4,The location.,"Our room was next to a road and the generator storage room - both were noisy.
The room was very small and had a green ceiling light on permanently which resulted in the room never being completely dark.
The tea/coffee was not replenished and access to our room was behind the restaurant which required going up a flight to come down via the emergency stairs which were very dirty."
6,I like the location of the hotel,The room is dirty and it is very small and when I asked for housekeeping they only come and take the trash and adjust the bed
6,"The location is great, nice neighbourhood","The rooms are dated, I had some flies in the room and the moth (wool eating one) - got rid of it and was alright, generally the cleaning was not great and a note was pushed really early on the morning (around 7am) that they couldn't clean the room for today, so we had to ask every single day to the room cleaned :/ not great!"
5,"Friendly staff. Fair breakfast.New,modern bathroom with good quality fittings. Plenty of towels and supplies in the bathroom.","Dark furniture in the bedroom , room looking out to a brick wall.Small supposedly superior room!!!!! 6 inch gab between bed and wardrobe very tight squeeze , I had to walk sidewards along the bed to get to the bathroom, have bruises to prove it if required. Poor quality yogurt and bread at breakfast."
4,The helpful receptionist.,"During my recent stay at a hotel, initially booked for 5 nights, I had to cancel the reservation for the remaining 4 nights due to a change in my plans. Upon arrival, I explained the situation, and the necessary adjustments were made. However, I was given a room on the underground floor, which presented an inconvenience. The layout required taking the lift to the first floor and then walking to the underground area, descending to the room from the other end. This setup was not very convenient, featuring dirty carpets among the old floors that resembled a fire escape, with no signs to guide guests. The price I paid for one night, £234, felt disproportionately high, especially considering the underground room and location. Additionally, the omelet eggs I ordered for breakfast were oddly flat, differing from what I've experienced in any other hotels. Overall, it was a unique and less-than-ideal experience."

6,Location was great,"Felt old and tired.
Shambolic room arrangements over several levels needing stairs to get to our room."
5,Good location but very mediocre and not a 4*,"Small bedroom, kettle didn’t work, shower leaked."
6,Location was ok. Shower and bathroom were very nice.,"Overpriced, mould on the windowsills, view of a brick wall, bedside lights unable to turn off- had to unscrew the bulbs"
3,Staff very friendly,Basin in bathroom wouldn't empty = breakfast was like going back to the 80 s - toasting bread awful - trying to safe a few pounds didn't work.
5,"Location was perfect for getting around. Really nice and central to what we had planned. 

The beds we’re comfortable","The place seemed to have seen better days. The carpets were old and worn. Most of the decor and walls were chipped and just a bit shabby. 

There was mouldy food in the fridge when we arrived which was very disgusting and just not really acceptable. The front desk did offer us a different room however, we had already unpacked and settled and couldn’t be bothered to repack everything. We just asked that they cleaned the fridge out for us which they agreed to do but when we arrived later in the evening, The food was still in there… we then took the food ourselves to the front desk and nothing was offered to make up for this. They did not really take responsibility and just blames the cleaning staff. 

The breakfast was also extremely disappointing. I really didn’t think you could go wrong with a breakfast buffet but I am wrong. Everything was over cooked and just bland. The juices weren’t re filled and the water even tasted a bit off. Really not what I expected from a 4 star hotel. 
We were told they only had filter coffee which would have been fine but after waiting 10 minutes for a cup, I then heard the sound of milk being steamed only to turn around and see that they,in fact, do have a coffee machine and were making barista style coffee."
4,Location!,"I have been in touch about the fact that, although I had booked from 22 until 26 October (4 nights), I was only able to stay three nights, because my flight was cancelled at the last moment. As I told you before, I have stayed at your hotel on a number of visits, so I was hoping for some consideration and “clemency”. The manager rang me about this and just focused on “loss of revenue”, which I found rather disappointing…..
Apart from that I think that in general my stay was not as good as on previous occasions. When I arrived, the lady at reception (Anna) gave me a form om which the amount was something like £ 820,— for four nights. I had the booking.com form with me and could show her it said £ 779,—. She said she would show me her booking.com form and then noticed it was indeed £ 779,—. Incidentally, there was a date of birth on her form that was not mine either. So I think she may have mixed up two guests. She could easily just have said , “I am sorry” rather than just “Oh”.
On one of the following nights, when I had a shower, the bathroom was flooded and water even went into part of the bedroom, near the threshold. I quickly called reception, someone brought extra towels and I was the one doing the cleaning and drying! (I wonder why….) The water coming from the shower just flowed away very very slowly. The next day maintenance saw to it. I hope it has been fixed. I did not shower after that one night.
Also, WIFI seemed to work less well than on previous stays. I don’t remember having problems with WIFI on previous stays! During this stay, in the morning and late at night, my device often said “no Internet connection”. Perhaps this is a case of installing more access points? No idea. As I said, there were no problems on previous stays.
So in all I am beginning to have some doubts about your hotel. Did I just have some bad luck? I don’t know. I do know that in previous stays I left feeling happier and more satisfied."
4,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"We left a pair of expensive sunglasses in our room. After contacting the hotel immediately after returning home by phone telling them exactly where they were, the hotel didn't return our call when they said they would. We then contacted by email after a considerable length of time they responded with a email saying they didn't find them. If the hotel had gone and looked or when the room was cleaned they would have found them.

4,Location was good,"Breakfast was awful, the food and coffee was really bland and tasted cheap. I had to request that the heating was put on in my room by reception as they had the controls which i was not aware of so i sat in a cold room for hours waiting for it to work. I travelled with my mum who has limited mobility and everytime i asked for help bringing up and down her mobility scooter at the entrance the staff made us feel like it was a chore for them. Where as other places we have stayed we have always felt very welcome and they would always offer to help us with her access issues. For the price we paid for the room we were very disappointed."

6,The welcome was friendly and staff were attentive. The room was fairly spacious and clean providing all the expected facilities (apart from a window).,"We were guided to our room by a member of staff which was helpful as we were taken down two flights of stairs and along a lengthy turning corridor to a gloomy room underground. There was no natural light, no window, and it was like staying in a dungeon. I'm not claustrophobic but the room was so dark without the lights on that we left the bathroom light on all night. It was not a pleasant atmosphere."

5,The room had everything needed.,"The room was too small suitable for Single person occupancy & not for couple.

the gym is the worst i ever experienced (old and not functioning equipment)."
1,location was handy but unsafe,"Everything!!! the photos on booking.com are deceiving. the hotel does not look anything like the photos. the property is extremely old and dodgy looking. The rooms are tiny which is fine coz it’s London, but the photos does not show that. The loos(women) in the reception did not have a lock and the handles were broken too.

The bed and the pillows were awful and kept us all awake because they were so uncomfortable. At around 2 o clock in the night, someone started hammering on the walls and all of us woke up due to that. When I mentioned this during checkout, the staff said ‘we don’t do any work in the night’ and that’s about it. I felt cheated and deceived bu booking.com. I will be very careful next time."
2,Staff was nice.,It wasn’t sound proof and we were upgraded to a room in the basement.
4,The hotel is very average.,Requires refurb. Poor lighting in the room. Staff unwelcoming and not much better than a premier inn.
1,Location,"Maintenance issues prohibited the shower and hot water to be available and had to be taken to another room for a shower only to find the same issue.
Reception also offered verbally a full refund of one night’s accommodation but when this was pursued via booking.com the hotel denied this and only offered a 10% discount on room fare.
Extremely disappointed and would not recommend or stay there again."
2,the staff were helpful,"no wifi or mobile network cover in original room and no natural light; after complaining, I was moved to another room where I could get 4g mobile cover but still no wifi."
2,Staff were friendly,"Room was nothing like we expected. False advertising & very disappointing. Loud intermittent noise from air conditioning system. No soundproofing from other rooms or hallway. No slippers or bathrobes here as advertised. This property is definitely NOT 4 star, more like 2. Booking.com need to go & take a look. Hotel is extremely shabby & desperately in need of renovation. Grubby carpets & surfaces. The advertising photos do not look up to date & make this property look much tidier than it actually is."
5,"Everybody is very professional and pleasant, but these small hotels in Kensington are like closets....and this one is no exception. The room was very clean and there was a tiny coffee maker, which helped.","We were put on the 1st floor with a view along one glass wall/window of brick walls and building vents. Breakfast is not included in the lowest price room rate. The room was a bit dark because of being against a brick wall. I was constantly bumping into things because there was almost no room for our tiny suitcases. Just a shower - no tub. All this for the low, low ridiculous price of $700+ for a two night stay! I know this is the going rate now - but PLEASE! It's almost like its not even worth going to London if the base hotel rate is this high. Any major city in the EU is a far better value. :("
4,Very clean. liked the style of the room.,"No security chain on the door. They couldn't find our booking,I know I booked last minute but was in a basement room with no windows. Skylight didn't provide any outdoor light but did produce a lot of noise. None of the light switches worked, couldn't turn lights beside bed off when wanting to go to sleep and didn't want to removed card from door in case there was an emergency where we needed light. No plug sockets next to the bed."
3,Location was convenient,"Room was tiny, noisy and smelly (next to the kitchen and bins), bed was uncomfortable, inconvenient having to walk up and downstairs to get to room with luggage"
6,LOCATION.,ROOM WAS TOO SMALL. NO PARKING WAS AN ISSUE.
2,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"We booked a superior room and found ourselves in a room/dungeon in the basement without a window. Beside the room was a public toilet that could be heard flushing constantly through the thin walls. Only after complaining were we moved to a room with a window in the category we had booked the following day. On arrival in the new room while lying on the bed I cut my finger on a broken piece of glass. After an inspection we found four small pieces of broken glass on the bed. The staff at the hotel lobby, who were unfriendly from the beginning, pointed out that only the cleaning staff and the bellboy had been in our new room and they could not have put the broken glass on the bed. We were quick to say that it wasn’t us but the feeling of being accused ourselves was obvious. We were offered all kinds of excuses from the manager and a bottle of Prosecco, which we declined. Apparently some fruit and a half bottle of complementary wine had already been placed in our new room as compensation for our dungeon experience. There was however, no note with an apology so we presumed the wine was to be paid for, thinking that it belonged to the minibar. Having become slightly paranoid at this point, I checked the kettle before boiling some water only to find it filthy, with a sticky brown mass inside. Overall a very unpleasant experience."

5,"Nice bathroom, good room cleaning, pleasant & friendly hotel staff ( other than in restaurant)","Small room; Limited common areas to relax -only a small lounge area, essentially used as a reception waiting place and bar was basically a makeshift counter in the restaurant area; Breakfast experience was poor with ungracious/unattentive staff and poor quality of food and drink."
3,Location was good and staff were very helpful and friendly.,We were put in room 008 - there was a huge pillar in the room which navigating around in the night in the dark was fun. The wardrobe area was tucked away in a corner where there was no lighting and the lighting overall was very poor as we there was no natural light as there were no windows in the room. there were 2 lanterns in the ceiling one directly above the bed which had been covered previously with some sort of black paint which had now started to wear off so as the sun rose in the morning from 5ish started letting some light in to the room and as it was in the ceiling there was no way to block it out. The walls were also paper thin. It was such a dark and depressing room and not at all what I expected for the price or from the pictures I saw on booking.com
5,central,a bit grubby
1,Proximity to the underground,I would not stay here again nor would I recommend this hotel to anyone. The service provided and quality of the rooms/ facilities was unacceptable for the price I paid to stay here.

4,"staff very pleasant and helpful, but not as well presented as they should have been. the cleaning, while the basics was done well, attention to detail, was lacking. taps were marked, not sparkling, as with the mirror, the shower grout was stained corners were neglected. bedding poor standard. just looked tired and neglected.","see above. 
perhaps management has changed?"
1,not at all.,it is not a hotel. 4 stars in booking.com is misleading. it is a linked house to the hotel the facility provides for us to stay.

6,The location was great as I was there for the London marathon. It was close to most of the cities sites!,"I didn't like that interior of the hotel seemed a bit run down, the room was okay, but there as a loud noise coming from the bathroom and I couldn't figure out what it was as it woke me up several times during my stay there. The beds were not comfortable I could feel the spring of the bed every time I sat on it. Not sure why a complimentary continental breakfast wasn't offered for the cost of the hotel stay, however, I was close to local coffee shops so it was okay."
4,The staff were pleasant and helpful but insufficient numbers of staff in the restaurant each morning.,"Being given an ""upgrade"" room to find it was in the basement and had no window and no wifi or mobile connection"
5,"The staff were very kind and helpful, they went out of their way to assist me. The location was convenient, and close to good restaurants (I recommend “Addie’s Thai” nearby!) The room was an OK size and my bathroom was very nice.","I’m a solo business traveller, I travel a lot for work, and have stayed in quite a few hotels in London. As it stands, I don’t think that the Park Grand Kensington offers good value for money and I would suggest shopping around for a better value hotel. The corridors are dark and like a maze (I got lost twice) my room was also dark, and the light switches by my bed were broken. The elevator was old and creaky, and breakfast was poor, the eggs were bland and they had a very limited selection (no yoghurt, and old looking fruit). I wouldn’t stay here again, as I believe the price is not competitive for what it offers. I was not offered a VAT receipt as a business traveler and had to request one (quite arduously) after my stay.

Finally, this may be more my personal taste, but their computer systems were extremely prejudiced, and, as a woman travelling regularly for business, it put me off staying here again. One example: to sign up for the wifi code you had to include your title, if you share a room the options were: “Mr & Mrs, Dr and Mrs, Colonel & Mrs, Lord & Mrs etc. etc”. What century is this?

My suggestions to management: 
1. Make necessary repairs to rooms and elevator, consider changing black netting on windows to white.
2. Improve your breakfast offering, it is expensive, it should at least be good.
3. Change the wording on your registration system and other documents."
4,Location and the staff were helpful and friendly.,"2 of the towels in the room were dirty.

Hotel looked neglected and grubby. Hallways smelt of cigarette smoke despite the plug in air fresheners that were dotted around."
3,It's generally clean.,"Noise in the room throughout the night. Beware the 'upgrades' at checking in. You'll get a large room somewhere that's not ideally located. This one was above the staff room on the ground floor, and there was talking right through the night. This hotel uses to be fantastic but not anymore. 

Had to change plans on a non refundable booking. With other nearby hotels you ask to change the date and they will do so and chnarge the difference. Not here, they don't even acknowledge, and they've done this on nunerous occasions. 

Won't stay again, despite staying here more than a hundred times over the past 4 to 5 years."
4,location,"poor value for money 
Triple room was located in basement with several stairs and corridors"
2,Good location. Very close to the underground and shops.,"We were given a room without a window (we booked a deluxe double room) and, when we asked to move to a room with a window, we were told there were none available that night and we would have to wait until the following day. We were woken up very early both mornings by noise in the corridors (sounded like the cleaning staff shouting to each other) and also by reception calling us 3 times early in the same morning to speak to us about our request to move room after we had already told them we would like to move later that day. 

Room was quite stuffy without a window and it was noisy to sleep with the aircon on. 

Corridor down to the basement rooms also smelled strange."
5,Hotel staff were very attentive and polite. Location was great for our stay too being so close to underground station and amenities. Hotel itself was very well maintained and breakfast was good.,"Our room did not feel great value for money. We were told we'd been given an ""upgrade"" which was actually just the sort of room I'd expected for the price and was actually in the basement which meant no natural light or ways of opening a window for fresh air. The WiFi would not work due to location of room and there was a constant banging of the doors outside all morning which woke me early and I could not get back to sleep after 7am. I had booked the hotel as a treat for my husbands birthday it said there would be fresh fruit and cookies in the room which there wasn't just didn't feel very ""deluxe"" considering what else was on offer in the area."

3,"Location, closeness to the main sights.","Customer service. First night I was downgraded instead of upgraded, after the ordered room was not available. The given room was lower in level and smelled. Was given a breakfast to make up for it, however even the breakfast was very poor."
2,Location was fine and he staff were very helpful,"My partner was suddenly taken ill on the 2nd day and we had to leave on the morning of the 3rd day without staying the 3rd night. 
Despite initially being told that we could get a refund for this unexpected medical issue, Park Grand Reservations have refused to do so because I had not given the required 24 hour notice. I have spoken to reservations on the phone and they confirmed that they would not giving me a refund for this reason despite the fact that this was a sudden medical issue.
While I accept that I had not given the required 24 hour notice, I do NOT think that this is a very friendly attitude given the medical nature of our sudden departure."
2,Nothing went well.,"The place is a tip. Cleaning is poor to non existent. The passage carpets are filthy. The manager Giles is a pleasant guy but either has problems recruiting good staff or is incapable of getting the best out of the existing staff. On our first full day there we returned to the hotel at about15h00 exhausted and looking forward to a rest only to find that our room had not been touched in our absence since 8h00 notwithstanding the fact that we had engaged the service light before leaving that morning. After complaining a cleaner was sent to the room while we vacated for at least an hour. On our return the room had at best been given a cursory once over. The bed cover had simply been pulled straight without the linen underneath having been straightened. A sweet paper on the bedside table had not been cleared away. Nether the towels nor the toiletries had been replaced or replenished. Indeed the wet towels had simply been rolled up and displayed as if they had been replaced. A further complaint finally saw the job done properly but at the cost to us of a further hour cooling our heels. On our third day this entire procedure was repeated as if on Ground Hog Day. A further meeting with Giles was held during which we were informed that the cleaners had until 16h00 each day to attend to the rooms. On other occasions the dining room did not open at the advertised 7h00. Annoying when you have planned your day. Sometimes queuing was required to access the woefully inadequate dining room space for breakfast. This no doubt exacerbated by the fact that the hotel also seeks to accommodate so called ""walk ins"" notwithstanding the inconvenience to residents. The lift (which I suspect is powered by a steam engine so laboured is its functioning) was not once cleaned during our 4 day stay. Indeed when we used it for the last time yesterday I noted to my dismay that a piece of paper which was on the floor of the lift on our arrival was still there undisturbed 4 days later."
4,Probably location was best,"the breakfast was very poor cold , and undercooked , reception far too small just full of suitcases , we weren’t able to check in till 3 o clock no apologies nothing 
I wouldn’t class as a 4 star hotel if the was a deluxe twin then I wouldn’t like to see standard room 
We even had to pay £31 quid for the breakfast even though it was cold , and you would have thought due to very late key check in they would have supplied it"
3,"Expensive booking.com rate was higher than standard hotel rate.
No WiFi in room that was the size of a cupboard (superior room)
Only positive was proximity to earls court tube station.","Incredibly small Room
Low quality Towels
Overall Price"
4,Staff are lovely.,"I booked 4 rooms. One was in the basement and not a deluxe room that we had booked. Very small. No space to move. My colleague had to request a move. Not idea for a business trip. 

My room was not great. The air-conditioning unit made loud noises every hour during the night - even though it was turned off! I had to also change rooms. 

The hotel itself is clean but is in desperate need of refurbishment. The furniture is old and very tired."
4,location,very small room only one chair for a double room -bad service at breakfast
6,The location was fabulous....anna was very helpful,"Bed very hard, i put milk in fridge...milk went of overnight, other rooms doors kept slamming late at night...didnt sleep for 3 nights due to this....told reception did nothing"
6,Location,Rooms were tiny. We were in the basement of the hotel which meant we had to go up and down multiple stairs and down corridors to get to our rooms.
4,not much. hotel is tired and not up to previous standard when stayed 5 years ago. the photos on internet are not current and do not match the rooms.,"first room offered was dirty, carpets frayed, bed cover torn, curtains dirty, corridors were dirty. we were offered a choice of 3 other rooms which were not up to standard expected. on 2nd day we were offered a treble room which was acceptable"
4,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"The pictures on Booking.com and TripAdvisor look much better than the hotel actually is. Everything fairly worn down, underground rooms are an impertinence. All much closer to youth hostel standard than to four stars."
3,initially clean and smart,it on second floor room - constantly disturbed by slamming door and when used shower in morning had to turn off as overflowing as drain blocked. went into the day sleep deprived and stressed without having had a proper shower. when asked for feedback said room was noisy and was told to ask for 5th floor next time …….

fridge and power didn’t work, even after we changed rooms once. we got a room 2 stories underground with no lights and the faucet was tarnished. this absolutely not a 4 star hotel and the charge on the credit card didn’t even match the name of the hotel."
6,the room was cool and quiet,Prostitutes in the lobby and on the steps

though some can be (unintentionally) rude- training issue
Low price for a 4*, but you immediately understand why upon arrival","Extremely poor bed quality (replacement long overdue)
Heavily soiled and dirty carpet throughout the
 hotel, including in rooms
Cheap and ugly furniture in rooms: microwave, towels, toiletries 
I was initially given a room in the basement, which I rejected."
2,Location was good,The housekeeping was extremely poor.
6,good location,staff weren’t helpful in certain situations
5,"Location perfect for west and central areas.
Staff very pleasant and helpful.","Dirty carpet, hasn't been cleaned in years.
Shabby finishings, with holes in chair, broken door frame, broken coat hangers.
Was celebrating an anniversary, staff said they would decorate the room and do something special - but didn't."
1,location,"TV didn’t work, no offer to change rooms to one that worked"
6,"The staff were helpful the second time we came down to complain about the room. They did move us into a better room, the correct one we had paid for I believe. The staff member on duty did look after us after fixing up our room.","Check in wasn't very friendly or informative. Our room was dirty, sheets dirty and not the room we had requested. The beer taps in the restaurant didn't taste clean either."
5,Location,"Cleanliness of room was poor and communal areas just as bad. Poor breakfast choice and standard of service. Nobody offered us tea/coffee or explained layout. Bar hardly open and when it was, there was nobody behind bar."
6,air conditioning in the room.,"On our arrival around 6pm on Friday 12th Aug the 3 reception staff were standing chatting to each other leaving us waiting, the lady who checked us in was not welcoming in the slightest and this had us disappointed from the off, any other staff we met over the weekend were very nice but on our initial experience we would not return here.

The room was downstairs in the basement with an inaccessible window which let in no light at all.

when the room was visited on Saturday while we were out the bed was made, the sachets of coffee/sugar I used were not replenished, there was no ordinary tea at all, just green and flavoured, the toilet roll was not replenished and the fridge did not work(room no 19) these things may seem trivial but the small details are what’s supposed to set you above the budget brands and other competitors which I’m afraid did not happen on this occasion. 

I recently checked my bank account to find I have been charged an additional £160 which I have emailed about but no reply as or yet."
5,La location,Quality price disappointing. Unacceptable they do not have espresso in a 4 star hotel. Breakfast not that great either. Too expensive for what you get
2,5 mins from Earl’s Court station.,"Too much to list, misleading hotel images."
4,There is no,"The hotel is very old and unsafe. I was surprised that one of the clients entered the room during my stay, and his response was that the receptionist gave him the same room number and the entry card for her."
4,The staff were friendly it was very clean. The decor was nice,The carpet was wet outside the bathroom. The “triple” bed was two beds pushed together that were different heights so there was a big dip in the middle
4,"location, breakfast, room SIZE was good","parking on web site, none. steps to enter building but no one help me with my bags into hotel. staff on phone’s or outside my bedroom window smoking/having a laugh. I was in below ground room noisy because of the above comment."
4,"Location and convenience, okay sized room.","A few things:
- a window which literally opens out to a white painted wall? (what on earth?!)
- a window which we had no idea about until in a towel after a shower where I discovered people were up above and able to look into our room where you leave the bathroom (had no idea about it and the blinds don’t work)
- carpets are stained, not great"
6,Location was good. Welcome supplies in the room.,Our room was in the lower ground floor so didn’t have a window with any view.
5,the bed,"that there were no windows and no view, there was also some weird platform beside the bed which seemed unnecessary"
3,The staff were so nice and couldn’t be any more helpful but the hotel is run down very small and does look like the pictures. The breakfast was good.,the hotel is run down very small and does not look like the pictures. Our first room had a hole in the wall which they tired to cover up with a curtain the second room we then moved to made banging noises all night in the bathroom I think it came from the pipes
4,Close to tube station.,"Stayed 4 nights.

Poor breakfast.

Room was very loud and other guests loud and disrespectful on our floor. When I complained to front desk - I was told it would not be a problem for my next night as they would be checking out. This is not a solution or even an apology! I felt like my complaint not taken seriously. 

Room not always cleaned well or restocked properly."
6,The staff were friendly,The hotel and rooms were tired and in need of refreshing and repair in parts. Not quite as nice as photos show.
5,Location and the reception staff,Matress not comfortable and the hotel is a bit old
4,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Living underground, no Windows no light, no ventilation, no power"
4,location was ideal for our needs. it was a single night stop over but felt cheap and not a four star hotel,the strange bathroom with a tiny hand sink difficult to access
3,the air con worked.,"the tiniest bedroom I’ve ever stayed in, especially as I booked a deluxe double room. TV didn’t work."
3,The staff were friendly.,We were charged £816 for two nights in a small noisy room in a very mediocre hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful but it was very poor value for money
3,"Location was good
Rooms were clean","Double rooms was tiny, could barely walk around the bed, nowhere for suitcases.
Staff were very unfriendly, they never said hello or smiled at us the whole time we were there."
5,Reception staff were helpful an courteous.,"The accommodation did not meet the description of the accommodation on booking.com. Booked two Superior Double rooms, both were on different floors, one was in the basement which we refused and asked to be changed. Reception advised that the rooms would be changed and upgraded, my friend was given a triple room, and I my upgrade despite requesting a double was in fact a twin room. Again had to go back to reception to complain and advised that I had booked a double bed, again without issue was offered another room, advised this was a further upgrade to a Superior Club double room, once again this did not meet the description on booking.com. Rooms were very tired and in need of an upgrade, all drawers on furniture were stiff and difficult to open, in my room the bathroom vanity mirror which looked like a touch light mirror did not light up and was not well secured to the wall. Hotel needs to check quality of cleaning staff as a previous days copy of the Evening Standard was found on my window sill once I had opened the curtains in full. Not enough room on desk area if you are getting ready for a night out. Shower was very slippery and it was only on tidying up to leave that I found a non slip mat rolled up and tucked up right in the corner underneath the bathroom sink. Picked up waste bin in main room to move it and this had a loose bottom and fell out. Stair well carpet was dirty with what looked like paint stains. On return from a theatre trip the evening of our stay my friend had hurt her ankle so we asked at reception for some ice and also a couple of bottles of soft drinks only to find the bar closed at 10.00pm and room service had also stopped at this time and staff had no access to the bar etc. On a couple of occasions late that night I popped out for a cigarette, on both occasions there was no one on reception, main door was open and no real security to ensure that only hotel guests could access the hotel so this really needs addressing."
6,good location.,Dark rooms and corridors. Breakfast rather bland.
4,the location.,"initially put in a basement room, with no natural light. new room was tiny, dated and in need of a proper clean"
3,location,"size of rooms, smells, breakfast"
4,Dinner food very good,Dirty passages and room in basement floor areas. Difficult to get to rooms.
5,The location rooms were very tired rips in the furniture marks on the bedding marks on the floor . Broken skirting boards . Definitely in need of a refurb the only nice place was reception looks very welcoming but the room were very scruffy looking,The only thing I liked was reception everything else needs a revamp
4,"Good room size, great location","Room was old and shabby, bed base was falling apart, part of shower handles were missing meaning you had no idea if the water was going to be hot or cold etc. Called down to order room service, sadly the person I spoke to couldn’t understand me and as such we had to give up on the conversation, infuriatingly. Ended up ordering Deliveroo instead. Not a great experience"
5,the location was great,"the room was advertised as a large double however it was tiny, the room was also incredibly dusty"
6,Location was close to the tube and was an ok location,"Cleanliness of hotel carpets, bathroom.
We were told trains would be running perfectly the day we left and they weren’t
Caused us to miss our flight and lost a lot 
Including the following hotel booked through booking . Com"
5,price,first room was in the basement. the good thing is that I was upgraded.
5,Location,Staff kind and helpful…. Our room was clean however the general room location took us around the bowels of the building which scruffy untidy and underwhelming…. Breakfast was also only average
6,"staff were great, very helpful and polite.","The location is in some respects handy, about 200m from Earl’s Court road tube station but the surrounding area is a bit of a dump."
5,"Breakfast was ok, staff seem to work very hard","Definitely not a 4 star
The communal areas were dirty, tired and old. The stairs carpet from reception to the 1st floor was covered in white paint which was trampled all way down the stairs carpet. The stair case down to the basement rooms were really tatty, dirty and grubby"
1,The breakfast was nice.,"our room was located next to the staff toilet which we weren’t informed of, so all through the night all we heard was the evening staff slamming the corridor door and the toilet door, which resulted in us being in reception at 4.30am complaining."
4,i liked the bed - comfy.,"arrived - people shouting at reception for incompetence - not answering phones, not sorting rooms, elevator not working, dark, smell of cigarettes in hotel 
Took to room by young chap - took to room on basement floors, corridors filthy - sent in photos things blocking elevator (not safe), and he took me to my room in kitchen lift...? and the having squeezed in .... he said sorry we are on floor supposed to be on...!, no lift but had luggage (crazy). When i asked at reception if i had a booking for the next two nights - they said no - i asked they check - they said no booking in my name - but could see my colleague - honestly at that point i was thinking good! tried to contact you about this - but no joy. I would add in the morning - once i found the reception - it was much tidier - i asked the lady in office who booked it to speak to hotel about horrible experience and to perhaps give us a credit note for another stay - but this time on a floor with a good room and near lift... i appreciate all this may because of late arrival but there are some basics you expect for $300per night! clean rooms, clean corridors, good appearance of hotel, and competent service - it was a sham!"
6,The bed was very comfortable,No window in the room and the skylight was blocked off because it was an area pigeons liked to sit on.
5,The property was in an excellent location to access the Natural History Museum and plenty of options for Restaurants etc. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful.,"We booked a Deluxe Double Room and unfortunately this didn’t live up to expectation. A very small room and the cleanliness of the room wasn’t great either. I did complain to reception and they moved us to another room which was supposedly a free upgrade, but the new room was just as small as the original and not clean again."
1,Bed was comfortable,"Breakfast not included, which I guess is standard in the UK but crazy, had to pay at the hotel, and then they didn't record that I paid for it so wouldn't let us eat until I showed them my bank statement.
Room was terrible, small, old, dirty, unable turn off main lights (had to remove bulbs) , and the room we were given was in the end of nowhere with a view of a wall and air-conditioning unit and a ratty pigeon. Paid a premium for what looked like a nice hotel and this was terrible"
5,Staff were helpful and friendly.,"Route from reception to room was terrible. Drain in shower made strange noises all night. Bed was uncomfortable.
When we walked through the restaurant (in the night when it was closed), we saw a big rat in the room. COnsequently, we avoided the breakfast we had paid for."
1,location,I was overcharged. There was a 300 GBP for breakfast on my bill on a day I wasn't even in the hotel. No one to explain questionable charges on my bill!! I will be reporting this!!!
6,The staff were super friendly and check in was easy.,The entire hotel has a strange smell and the bed was two singles pushed together which made it very uncomfortable to sleep on. I was shocked by this as I paid over 200 pounds a night.
4,Good location,Being in a room below ground level
4,The best thing about the hotel was the distance away from the nearest tub station (Earle’s court).,The room. Apparently the room we stayed in was upgraded from the superior double I’d paid for. The ‘upgraded’ room was very small. The only window faced a brick wall approx 1ft away. The bath and washbasin both had a drainage issue so we had 12hrs of stagnant used water the following morning.
6,A good location,"Overpriced, could do with a refresh, not a particularly open welcome!"
5,The English breakfast was fairly good and not badly priced.,Wifi hardly worked in the hotel. Many guest were complaining about it not working. Very few outlets to plug things into. Very comfortable beds.
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,rooms smelt strongly of cigarettes and smoking
6,"Location and front of house staff excellent. Disappointed to be 2 floors ""down"" rather than up so no window with natural daylight apart from one at the entrance door which was so high up that it does not count. Room smelt musty although it was very clean so some air freshner or candles would have helped. The hotel bar was also closed around 10 pm which is very early",Air freshners in the room. Later opening for the bar.
6,"Location was excellent for tube station, nice pubs and handy for shops.

Room facilites were excellent i.e. tea/coffee making, microwave, fridge, tv, iron and ironing board, hairdryer and bathroom towels and shower gel and shampoo etc. 

Evening meal was very nice.","The size of the room .... especially the bed.

At breakfast the staff were not clearing tables to meet the guests who were wanting breakfast ... we had to wait on both occasions to be seated, the first time we were asked to wait in the lobby and we would be called when the table was cleared. They forget us. Also, the hot breakfast food was cold."
6,"Staff were friendly, helpful and the location was excellent.",I was given a smallest room with smaller bed hadly to sleep with 2 persons for a higher rate and breakfast excluded.
6,"Staff were very nice, bed was comfortable, hotel was quiet at night. Checkout time of 12.00 Midday was helpful and better than the usual 10.00am or 11.00 am, but everything else was no better than average.","Booked the hotel because of lots of very positive reviews on Trip Advisor, but I now doubt their authenticity. Hotel was no better than average across the board and it is hard to believe the expressed enthusiasm. Breakfast buffet hot items were cold, shower in room which was meant to be a wet room type did not drain and flooded the toilet after 2 showers each day. In the room when we arrived were a freebie bottle of wine, which was nice and bottled water, but it was mostly down hill from there. Nothing totally dreadful, but generally the hotel decor and furniture is old and in need of a bit of an upgrade and in particular the lift was dirty and very small."
4,The location was fantastic,"Value for money was terrible
“Routine fire drill” at 1.30am evacuated the whole hotel in the middle of the night and then no compensation was offered"
3,The hotel is a very good location. We stay here a lot because of this.,On this occasion the room was TINY (09). The fridge did not work. AND I had to unblock the shower myself. It was blocked with the lid of one of the provided shampoo bottles and a used condom on the top. Was not impressed at all.
5,Staff really nice unusually they actually provide bottled water.. when I requested more they gave me a couple more,My room was in the basement mo windows. A floor which had some cables underneath the carpet that I tripped over twice. The cleaners store room was.also there so I couldn't have a lay in
2,Very Nothing,Very bad accommodation not recommend to any one to stay unfriendly staff very unhelpful staff very rude staff
2,Location was why I picked this hotel it is close to the tube nothing else was good,The superior double room was about 9 feet square there was only just enough room for my suitcase. To reach the desk I had to climb over the bed. The bathroom was so small there was no room for toiletries and had to squeeze past the door to use the toilet.
6,"Location is good, close to the metro and on a quiet street. Breakfast is decent. However, they tell you to pay if you want a cappuccino instead of normal coffee.","The hotel in general is dated: you can see signs of wear in the elevator and in the room. Here's a hinge missing, here's a window handle broken. Here's mold in the bathroom. Here's a hole in the curtain (probably left by a cigarette). The first room had hard and old pillows that need to be replaced.

Cleanliness. Don't get me started. There was constant noise in our first room (112) at night and for the second night we asked to be moved. When I entered the bathroom, I saw a distinct shoeprint on the shower floor. Along with small curly back hairs. Ew. The sheets looked like they were washed and ironed, but still had dirty stains on them.
Also, in our first room the maid put body lotion along with shampoo and shower gel and the second room had conditioner but no lotion. Are hygiene products given out randomly? Also, housekeeping didn't replenish tea when cleaning. 

There were also soap/cleaner stains on metal parts of the shower.

Staff. We were promised free breakfast for the first night. We came to the restaurant and the waiter wasn't informed the day before. We stood there like two idiots waiting for them to decide if they'll give us free breakfast. Finally they did and then wanted to charge us for cappuccino :) The maid rang the bell at 8 am in the morning. We didn't have the 'do not disturb sign' to be fair, but I don't think many people are out of their rooms at this time already. Never happened to us before in any other hotel. Staff is also smoking in front of the main entrance to the hotel. This doesn't give you a pleasant feeling.

Soundproofing. Doesn't exist. You can still very well hear what's going on in the other room and especially in the corridor."
6,"General hotel location, cleanliness, bathroom nice and clean",Room was in the basement and not properly ventilated and obviously no light. Primary reason for my low rating of the property.
5,Location,"Breakfast, internet connection , room cleaning"
5,The bed was very comfortable. The room was clean. The bathroom was nice.,I could not open the window. I kept having to ask for tea bags - they were not replaced. The fridge did not work.
5,Breakfast,"We were put in a very dark, dated room that was on the basement level, there seemed to be much nicer rooms on a higher level. It was clean though"
5,staff were friendly,"room was small, location was ok, lift was extremely slow to arrive, not overly clean rooms, bathroom small"
6,modern interior and good location,"I stayed in room 011 which is interconnected to next room with an interior door offering zero sound proofing. I was kept awake with every cough, sniff, spoken word etc etc. spoilt the stay for me and something which could be easily fixed."
4,it was ok.,very worn and not a 4* property at all
4,staff were very friendly,"massively overpriced, not sure how the hotel achieved 4 stars. Shabby, worn out, small rooms, small beds, poor hotel layout. breakfast not included despite paying £165. felt ripped off"

5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,the room was very small
5,"A four night stay at the Park Grand. I arrived at the property in a hurry, was given a room facing a brick wall. I immediately went back to reception and asked to be changed, the second room I received was next to the lift it was however overall clean and well laid out. Staff were very friendly and tried their best to help. I ate at the Turmeric restaurant one night and the food was very tasty. The location is good there are many restaurants and other amenities within meters of the hotel.","The wifi is the worst and the slowest I have ever experienced. I reported this to the gentleman at reception, he offered a solution but it didn't work. Think internet 20 years ago, where you have to wait for the pictures to load. Forget about watching videos, I eventually disconnected wifi and worked on 5G. This clearly opts out business travelers from this property. Not all rooms are the same standard, my room didn't have bathrobes and slippers or the mini bar that others alluded to in their reviews. Linens, although clean, are quite cheap, poly cotton. One of the reasons I booked this property was to have a gym, as soon as I booked I got a note to say that due to COVID access to the gym is not possible. This should have been flagged up front booking.com!!! Come on stop using COVID as the excuse. I was also awoken every morning at 6.45am by a mechanical noise (maybe the lift shaft) which lasted about 30 seconds. Would I stay here again, probably not."
6,"The hotel is quite central and close to transport networks, restaurants, etc. The breakfast was very good. Majority of the staff were quite friendly and provided good service. We really appreciated the late check out - gave us time to properly sleep in on our last day.","It was just the room we received, it felt like it was in a basement - so it was quite dark, and there was no view. Some of the furniture was a bit dusty - but noticed some changes after housekeeping on our first day."
5,proximity to Earl's Court.,"My room was underground with no natural light.
Wardrobe in a corner was half blocked by a chair and no light inside or near so could not see anything inside it !"
4,not a lot,looks very different in photos compared to real life… much lower quality than you would expect! staff were nice but rather clueless and instead of resolving issues they just disappeared .
2,cannot remember,"Dirty carpet, no lost and pound, battery chargers, cigarettes, and other trivial things disappeared if left in the room. Never leave valuables in the room."
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"the first day we arrived the room was nothing like the pictures it was extremely narrow and with no amenities.
We requested a change and they took us to a better one but the damage was already done mood wise."
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"A loveless enterprise if I ever saw one. It’s as if as if no one put any thought into it whatsoever and it was conceived in a quick meeting between an investor and a realtor. The entrance looks ok but that only way to get to my room was by first going to the first floor, walking a long dark hallway and then taking a smoke filled emergency stairway down to ground level again (not connected to the lobby). The room was ok. The people were kind, which made me sad for them."
6,Location - well situated - very close to Earl‘s Court underground station and therefore perfect to get to the City centre!,room (very thin walls - unfortunately drunken and loud room neighbours); staff not really friendly and inconsiderate - got worse in comparison to our last visit
6,"the interior design was classy, the heated floors in the bathroom were an amazing touch, the breakfast was outstanding and the hole atmosphere was classy, amazing and friendly staff","the air conditioning unit didn’t work in the room, the queen size bed was just two single mattresses put together and could do with extra pillows"
6,I didn't like the room. No 11,A cleaner room. From the bed I could see tea stains on the wallpaper.
5,"Good breakfast, good location - close to Earl’s Court tube station",Room was far too small for 2 people and quite dark. View was a brick wall. Also felt damp - alot of condensation on windows in morning.
5,fantastic value for money. staff were exceptional.,sorry but the emergency room green light was a major problem for a good night sleep!
6,The breakfast was fine. We didn’t eat there every morning because there was little variation in the choices.,"The room was in the first floor. There was quite a bit of street noise especially at night. There was some sort,of halfway house across the road, police,on the scene more than a few times.

The window didnt seal properly and had a poor fix it in the upper corner of the window.

One day we returned to our rom after 3 pm and the room had not been serviced."
3,"The room was large, this was a bonus. And by far the only thing that I liked.","Scruffy.
Noisy Prostitutes all night.
No windows.
Electronical tape holding things together."
5,the location is excellent for all the museums and royal attractions. If coming from Gatwick airport it is very easy hotel to get too,when checking in the receptionist I was dealing with made the check in process overly complicated. insisting on making the holding fee and remaining fee as separate charges for each room I booked. I have stayed in this hotel mainly times before and this is the first time it has ever happened like that. am unlikely to stay here again as a result.

5,Breakfast was poor.,The front desk staff wasnt very friendly.
4,the location,quail it’s of the room was not up to a 4 star hotels
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,No window in my room
4,The staff were very friendly and professional. Decent shower. Excellent location.,"We were stuck in what I can only describe as the naughty corner in room 005. Up one floor, down a corridor, then down a grubby flight of stairs and into the farthest corner of the hotel. The room was very small and although there was a two door wardrobe one of them could only open about 3 inches due to a bedside table. The extractor fan in the bathroom was almost completely ineffective. The worst thing however was the smell of cannabis in the room. I can only assume that it was from people outside the back of the hotel smoking weed. They did offer to move us the next morning, but as it was only a base for two nights we didn't bother. 
Won't book this hotel again. There is a Premier Inn round the corner or an Ibis Style a few doors down and we'd have been better off going to either of them. 4 stars? I don't think so."
5,"The Hotel was close to the Tube Station , staff were friendly and a good breakfast was provided.",On arrival there was confusion about our booking as allegedly they mixed us up with someone of a similar name! My Tv had no volume and although I reported it when discovered in the afternoon when returning at night it had still not been fixed. When I complained it was then fixed quickly! The reception kept getting my room mixed up with my Grandsons and sent the TV repair team to his room. Additionally at one point one of the staff used a pass key and entered his room whilst he was in it and him having Autism this worried and disturbed him. I did not think the room was a 4 star deluxe room it was pretty ordinary to be honest.
1,location,"basement room, lights not working, noisy toilet sounds all night, fabrics in room damaged and scruffy. wanted to move rooms but nothing available"
3,"Changed rooms after first night. Reception staff excellent
Near to tube station","First room was dreadful , on lower ground floor . Stairwell and corridor to the lower floor had peeling wallpaper and grubby carpet. The room had a pungent smell of cannabis. Unable to change rooms until next day"
5,"good location. breakfast was okay, room was technically clean","‘upgraded’ to 003 would have rather been in a smaller room as was so hard to get to and had to walk through the stairwell that is obviously where people take smoke breaks outside the fire door. room was kind of care worn? bed, sofa and chair all really worn. Noise from people in the street outside our window during the night. Also when we came back after housekeeping had been could smell weed. In a cheaper hotel none of this would have bothered us but it was our honeymoon and we wanted it to be more special than it felt."
5,Good area,If its cheap its always different people....
6,Close to Earl’s Court station,"1. On 3rd floor, one could hear every passerby in the street below. Not just loud shouts, but normal conversations…so you can imagine what it might be like when a couple start fighting in the street at 3:00 am, or when vagrants are talking loudly or when cars and trucks drive past.

2. Breakfast was passable but coffee was not. Whatever brown liquid was served did not cut it so I ordered an Americano, which turned out to be as good as the soluble Nescafé in the rooms. And for which was considered an extra charge.

3. Not sure who attributes hotel ratings, but this was certainly not a 4 star."
2,The breakfast,"Noise, beds, no window"
6,the location,"we had to move from the first room, we stayed the week before in a nice room, this wkd the way to the room was dirty, domestic staff were smoking and after a strong smell of cigarette smoke, there was a strong smell of weed too!!!
We reported this to the receptionist and we were moved to a nicer room and cigarette and weed smoke free!!"
6,location and value and staff helpful .,"beds not very comfortable ! only two pillows and hard and pillow case had a stain on it . 
asked if I could have more pillows and was told they were short but they did supply some ."
4,Breakfast ok. Location good for what we were doing.,"Room service. Bed not made, tea cups not cleaned and no replenishment of tea and milk"
6,"Good location, 200 metres from Earls Court Station. Friendly staff.","We were staying five nights, the first room they put us in was a second-floor room, small and directly over the kitchen with a huge fan duct going through our room making a constant humming noise. When we complained about this room they immediately moved us to a bigger room on the fifth floor which was much better, but it makes me wonder why they put us in the first room to begin with when they obviously know this is a big problem. Also, we paid for a superior room which the first room was not. The second room was a good size but so hot that we turned off the heating for the full five days even though it was 7 degrees outside this room was very warm."
2,The dining staff were fantastic,"From the minute we checked in to the moment we left the front of house staff were dismissive and rude.
We had experienced several transport problems due to the weather conditions and train cancellations. Despite being left with no option than to arrive a day later than expected we were charged full price for our room, which, we never got to stay in that night.
We were offered the option to re-arrange our booking but we had show tickets. We were not allowed to re-arrange one night for a later date, this was only possible if we cancelled both nights. 
The photos show the “view” from our window and the lack of attention paid to the cleaning."
6,"decent bed, clean but small bathroom. Good shower",Further out of town than it seems
5,the decor,small bathroom
6,"clean, staff nice and good maid service.",room was small and cramped. seemed to be moths in the room. not the best value for money.
6,"Great clean hotel, Rooms standard hotel design. Size was practical. Main reason for choosing this hotel was its location to attractions",Beds far too soft for my liking.
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Quite expensive for what it is - it is an aging hotel. Staff is friendly but somehow not the most efficient (took them 20mn to find my luggage in the luggage room on the last day, which I had to go get myself in the end!)"
6,The staff were very helpful and attentive.,"The location! We generally stay at the Marlyebone and are quite familiar with that part of London. I was attempting to save money by booking us at the Park Grand, and I the end it was not worth it!"
4,location,"cleanliness, comfort"
5,"Breakfast was good, the room size was good.","Our room wasn’t cleaned before we arrived, our bed had hairs in it too. The room was noisy (a ventilator or something?) I was offered a complimentary upgrade next time but I’d already booked the top room and it wasn’t clean…"
3,Great price for location,The walls are so thin. My neighbours are coming in and out of their room laughing and carrying on until 3 am. It was a horrible night sleep.

6,Location was perfect,Staff smoking and talking outside our bedroom window all through the night. Room 10
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,We found the staff really impolite and unhelpful I almost wanted to check out early because of this. The hotel room was also absolutely tiny and misleading from the description online. We were also promised we’d receive our deposit back but we never did. I would seriously never return
5,location,outlook from room and price when booked ahead - much cheaper on wowcher deal
6,"Location, trouble finding hotel at first though, directions could have been better but once found it it was ok","Food not brilliant, cold and coffee cold too, lift very slowly quicker to use stairs"
4,Staff were pleasant and helpful but promised complimentary bottle of wine never arrived in the room.,"Location was okay for museums but poor for theatre visits. The original room we were given was like a box with no outside windows. The room certainly didn’t match photographs on the website. We were given a better room when we complained but the promised bottle of wine never materialised. 
Duvet was too small for the bed and bottom sheet did not stay tucked in overnight."
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,too long wait for room service so was not able to eat
5,location is great. close to the tube,"shower heads was probably not cleaned for the past years… if you have a rain shower, then make sure it’s clean. also - looks like stepping into the 80/90s with the furniture… so not worth the ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
3,Staff really friendly,"Allocated a basement room, pitch black with no natural sunlight. Furniture was chipped and old and the carpet was dirty with rips in. Walls had marks all over them and rips out of the wallpaper."
5,Great location,No window in the room. needed to remove key card to get all lights off. uncomfortable bed and pillows
5,the staff of the reception are nice,"the carpet of the room is so dirty, and the shower pressure is poor almost no water coming from the shower,, the stairs were dirty"
1,"nothing, have been mis sold my room","having to ask to ve moved 3 times, before getting a room that still wasn't what we'd booked

photo attached below of what they said is my CITY VIEW ROOM, that you and the hotel advertise"
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,My bed shocking. It was sagging in the middle and caused me great pain. I did not sleep very much due to the lack of support It ruined me for the following day. I cannot understand why the cleaning staff did not notice. Once the duevet removed the was a major dip in the mattress.
1,Staff were terrible . Room,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
3,The indian restaurant attached to hotel was superb,"Room had failed air conditioning and it was 30 degrees outside. So hot. After 3 visits by staff it still didnt work. Had to move rooms at 1am. Hotel staff /manager in my opinion were dismissive the following day regarding the issue and despite the hotel boasting air con, no partial refund was offered. Instead if you spend more money with us (for the 3rd time) and stay again we will see what upgrades we can offer!!! After ruining my wedding anniversary - I dont think it's likely I'll be back!"
1,Nothing 👎🏻,"I’ve stayed in several hotels in london for the past 10 years ranging from 3-5 stars. This is definitely the worst experience i’ve ever had. Never again even if it’s for free. 
Unfriendly staff very rude. They will not listen or solve any issue, simply they don’t care."
1,Nothing!,AC didn't work. Drapes didn't fit windows resulting in early morning wake up. Room on internet not representative of actual rooms.
2,The staff were friendly and welcoming,"Very run down, unclean. Corridors lines with what i assume to be pest control catchers “cityspec”"
1,Hotel location was good for what we wanted,"Checking in was slow. The young man was very helpful but it was only his 2nd day and he wasn't getting the help he required from other staff. The room was awful, lights didn't all work and the switches were missing the dimmer button. Bathroom was dirty and there was mould on the walls, shower head was clogged up and was disgusting. When we returned from our evening the hotel staff didn't even acknowledge us (a hello or good evening would go a long way) we had the same in the morning, whilst going for breakfast it seemed like a complete hassle we were there, took 10 minutes for our hot drinks to arrive, had the cooked breakfast and regretted it ever since as have been unwell."
1,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"The bed sheets were very dirty, and the towel seems like it has been used from the people before me, there were used q-tips and used products inside the unclean towel .. also my luggage lock was jammed, seemed like someone tried to unlock my luggage while I was away for the day exploring the city."
5,The location,"The room is too small. The bed is very uncomfortable and pillows , you hear all the footsteps above you walking, cannot open the window as the room faces out to an old section of the hotel, the pictures where not of the room I thought we would receive very dissatisfied, it's definitely not a four star as shown in booking"
6,A short walk from the tube with numerous local hostelries.,"Our room was on the lower ground. No window, air con temperamental."
1,It was a good location,"The bathroom was dirty
There was no water available in the room 
The mattress was broken and extremely uncomfortable
The room was not made up in the day"
1,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,The worst staff ever
3,"The hotel is located in Earls Court & is w located to Earls Court tube station, supermarkets, restaurants, & pubs.","The room! I was in a room downstairs with no natural light, the hallway & room had a horrible smell. Initially I thought it was a leftover food smell, but it was worse than that & it didn’t dissipate. I was given a can of air fresher so I wasn’t the first person to have this experience. The fridge didn’t work."
3,location,room was very small. did not have space to put the luggage. Bad was very very small. not enough space to move otherside of the bed.
2,Staff were friendly. I ate in the restaurant the first night. The food was absolutely spot on and I can't fault that at all. Service was slow and the restaurant was not busy.,"I was in the basement. there had been a leak from the toilets so the experience was not good. The floor should have been closed. The receptionist came with me to start me on my journey but then when she said, your room is just through those doors I let her go and then couldn't find my room. had to go through some more doors and then up some stairs (09) A random gentlemen helped me. The TV in the room did not work. I could have called reception but had lost the will to live by that time."
3,Location,Dirty and rundown
1,Nothing,"The room wasn’t what we’d booked. The staff were rude, there was damage to items in the room and facilities didn’t work. When reported they said they’d send a maintenance man who never appeared."
1,Location,"The rooms are sooo small staff very rude specially the person who checked me out very rude and unprofessional 
No water in the room housekeeping u have to ask for them to come and clean"
2,"Location of the hotel was close to the Earls Court tube station, some nice cafes and bars around.
Breakfast was ok, full English, fruits, continental meats, cheeses and pastries. Food was being replenished and price of breakfast was quite good for London prices.","Check in was very slow, room not ready on arrival. When we did get allocated our room we were in room 008 which is located in the basement. NO windows. No daylight. No working air conditioning. No phone to ring reception. It felt like a panic room. The size of the room was good for
London but that was it. If the room had been advertised as no windows I would not have been disappointed, like on a cruise you can select an inside cabin and pay less, however paying full price I was extremely unimpressed and uncomfortable. The hotel decor is at best 3 star, definitely NOT 4 star for any aspect- service, facilities, room or food."
1,Location is very close to Earl’s Court station on the Piccadilly Line,"BED BUGS. My husband was viscously”attacked” and despite medication,is still suffering and very itchy today, 8 days since being bitten. This is not a 4 star hotel and should not be rated as such."
1,Nothing,"The price of the room is excessively expensive for the service provided. 
There were blood stains on the walls, white stains on the floor, and it was very dirty. 
The maid stole €250 and £20 from me. Despite my complaint, they say it wasn't her, but it's the only place and time my money was left unattended (be careful with your valuables and money). 
Additionally, I suspect there are hidden cameras in the bathroom (at the very least) because there was no fog in the center of the mirror after a very hot shower (a large square was intact), and it sounds hollow behind it"
3,location close to the tube.,room much too small with very little storage. breakfast poor in terms of choice and was cold.
3,location,"everything ! poor service, cleanliness and breakfast was fair . the room I was put in was only how I can describe it as the basement with no natural light, the window was covered in bird poo and I was woken each morning at 4:30 am by the pigeons . the stairwell going down to basement was very unclean with the carpet being the dirtiest I ever ever seen ! I will not be staying there again"
1,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"The filthy, unhygienic shower.
Appalling condition and to be offered £50 off my £903 bill is not good enough. Room not serviced and no water for 2 hours on arrival"
2,Location close to Earls Court station,"Extremely unclean, toilet facilities if using the restaurant downstairs, uncomfortable bed, duvet doesn't cover the bed despite the right size linen. Floors Extremely dirty. Hand soak replaced each day (single soak wrapped in paper). Absolute waste when there was hardly any used. Hotel apparently have better rooms, which is poor as all rooms should be of the same cleanliness (confirmed by email from duty manager)."
4,Location,"The room is full of light pollution. 2inches under the door light flooding in. Microwave flashing red light, TV bright red light. Curtains thin. Noisy windows are single glazed could hear people in the street talking. Room small. Bed uncomfortable and pillows past their life.l"
2,The property is extremely tired. It's clearly not maintained.,Sadly there is really nothing positive here.
3,Breakfast was good and location is good.,"Room was dirty and hotel was really noisy all nights. There was pipes making noise all night, if you didn’t want the maid walking in at 9am then you have to have a red light on all night. Small mirror in the bathroom fell off several times. Reception staff didn’t seem to understand English very well when I was complaining about the issues we were facing. The bed was really soft which caused us some pain the next day."
1,When we left,"Awful!!! We were supposed to stay 5 nights but lasted one and left. Hotel was not clean, strong smell of rodent urine which they tried to masque with far too many air freshers to the point they made you have a headache. I was kept awake most of the night with h the sound of scratching and scurryjng in wall cavities. There were pest control boxes sat openly i. View on the lamdings. The breakfast was absolutely vile, requested a refund, still waiting the hotel is not responding. Awful place please avod."
1,Nothing,"The room
The dirt of the building 
The rude staff, to be fair not all of them were rude but the majority of them
The breakfast was inedible and was set out on a couch!!"
2,Location was convenient and easy parking near by,"Room was terrible, found mould in the shower and in the corner of the room. I asked for a double but was given two singles of differing give pushed together meaning I spent the night attempting to sleep on a slope but I shouldn't have worried, sleep was not on the cards as there was a light in my room that was permanently on and seemingly had no switch to turn it off."
4,"The rooms was ok, although a deluxe double bed turned out to be two single beds pushed together.","The room was ok, although we upgraded our room for an extra fee, we didn’t get the room we had booked, staff informed us that two single beds pushed together was better than the deluxe double room and bed we had paid for, bathroom and room was clean, we can not say that for the breakfast area and their lifts were out of working order."
1,Nothing.,"I had a very poor experience staying at this hotel. At checkin I was allocated a room below ground. The room was OK but there was a large wet patch on the floor at the foot of the bed. It looked like a leak or something. The room also had no window and was dark. I asked at reception for them to inspect the room whilst I went out for some dinner - they didn’t. When I returned they sent some very awkward young man with poor communication skills to inspect the room with me. However something must have been lost in communication as when we got to the room he simply turned around and left. I had to chase him back to reception and ask him to come back - he clearly hadn’t listened and just thought he was showing me to the room. At this point it was getting very late and I just wanted to go to bed but they found me a different room. On entry to that room it was even worse - again below ground level, absolutely no windows (a fake one that when you opened the curtain it was a boarded up wall), there was disgusting looking stains on the bed base and some unappealing yellow crusty bits around the mattress. I found a spot of blood on the sheets and the room was quite dusty. The lighting was terrible and as the room was split level, I struggled to see the little steps one night and took a tumble down them. Overall it was just awful. I asked if they had another room but this was all they had. As it was so late, I just had to sleep there although I got no rest whatsoever. My exchanges with the staff at reception were often bizarre and underwhelming - they appeared to have basically no social or customer service skills, it was very strange. I won’t stay again and would never recommend this hotel."
1,We did not stay and i need to speak with a person. I have sent emails and getting no information.,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
3,"Location, polite staff","Disgusting old mattresses, moved rooms at 10pm to a slightly better but still really poor old mattress, and the room smelt like damp/ mould. Not how the hotel was when I went a few years ago."
2,"Location was good, close to earls court tube station","It was dirty (like layers of dust, clearly hadn’t been cleaned properly in weeks if not months), walls were like cardboard and could hear everything outside, bed was so uncomfortable and even though I paid for a double room it was just two twin beds pushed together with a very obvious and uncomfortable seam down the middle. Also didn’t feel secure, no room key required to enter hotel in the evening or even to use the lift / get into separate floors. DEFINITELY should not be a four star rating."
6,Location perfect for the purpose of our visit to London.,"Room would not be classed as clean, the lampshades above the bed were filthy, stains all over them. The glasses in the bathroom were also not clean, watermarks all over them. Charged for water."
3,"Staff were friendly enough, however when handing key cards in at the end I was smiled at then the receptionist turned and said something to the other member of staff with her, they then proceeded to look at us and giggle which I found incredibly rude. Left a nasty final thought for the rest of the day. Bedding/Towels were clean. Naan Bread was delicious. Perfect spot for transport in and out of London.","They say they offer 24 hours room service, they don't, in fact you cant order anything after 10pm, and the bar is also closed at this time ! Bed was very soft and no spring left in it at all. Windows were dripping with condensation in the morning, couldn't open the window even a little to help matters so everything was damp. The heating didn't work, the room was either freezing cold or boiling hot, nothing we did made a difference. No subtitles on T.V, husband is deaf in one ear meant we had to have TV loud for him to hear, also there was no schedule so you couldn't see what was on. I also found it expensive for what we got, room was tiny compared to photos, damp smell in corridor and room. Light switch by bed didn't work and I had to unscrew the bulb to turn out the bedside light. Bathrooms have seen better days. I try not to book chains when we go away but this stay made me realise we would have been better off in a larger chain."
1,Nothing,"Blood/discharge on the fitted bedsheets. Informed reception and room cleaner but sheets were not changed whilst we were there for 2 nights. When leaving the hotel, I informed again at the reception and the lady didn’t show any empathy what so ever. 

Restaurant breakfast was extremely disappointing and when requested for porched eggs and hot chocolate drink, staff refused. Saying it’s not included in the breakfast package unless I pay extra :("
1,"Location was not good. Long way from everything.
Absolutely nothing to like.",Room was so tiny for a Superior Double Room. My husband had trouble fitting down side of bed and the wardrobe. I'm 49kgs and also struggled. Midget room. We had 4 suitcases and it was a struggle getting them all into the room. They do not clean room unless requested but do not tell u this when checking in. Curtains had holes in plus dooner was too small for dooner cover. Not good when it's cold. Worst experience we had whilst travelling Europe for 6 weeks. Staff unsympathetic and rude. I want my money back as it was not cheap. We booked all accommodation through bookings.com and this was the only hotel that failed. All the rest were fantastic.
1,The staff was good.,I was in room 005 they took me to the basement and it was shocking. Hard to find the room. Enroute I saw rat traps on the floor. Whilst in the room I could hear everyone above me. Foot steps floor squeaking everything. The smell of the hallways was not pleasant. The place needs some love because the location is nice.
4,Nice location 2 minute walk from underground,"Lipstick on the sheets. Room not very clean. 

Sewage smell in lobby on the day of check in"
1,location,"breakfast was very bad, as i found hair in the food.
staff didn’t bring bedding when asked as they said “we have to wait till morning”"

Bed was dirty when arrived at property."
6,"The location was close to the underground;
The staff was very friendly.
The room and the bathroom were clean.","The bed was to narrow for two adults.
The breakfast didn't have enough choices.
You have to pay extra for an espresso."
2,Location was excellent near Earls court station 2 mins away,"Room was very small and cramped and in the basement not easy to get too with luggage, decor not great, hallway carpets very dirty and stained.
Staff not helpful and no facility to leave bags when checking in or out - this caused us a major issue on our final day when we hoped to leave luggage in hotel and explore London for the day - many other guests were also not happy with being able to leave bags in hotel whilst they explored London . This wasn't communicated prior to booking and caused a bad end to a lovely trip.
 Despite excellent location i would not use this hotel again. It was not value for money and i expected alot more."
5,The room was spacious.,"The bed was so uncomfortable, we slept terribly. To get the shower to work we had to scrub the limb scale off the shower head and there was a green emergency exit light on all night so the room wasn’t dark."
1,Nothing was not up to standards,Room was dirty hairs on the bed unpleasant smell
1,"Good location
Close to underground metro","I never wrote a bad review, I usually choose just to not to return or use the services again.
The hotel is not maintained and for the price we paid, it is extremely dissapointing and frustrating as it was not cheap. 
The carpet is very old and smelly, the curtains look horrendous, dusty and with holes most probably cigarettes burns, dark mould marks at the ceiling corners behing the curtains. Marks on the wall, room needs repainted. At the bathroom, the water didn't drain properly at the shower, the pipe was blocked we had to call reception to unblock it. Don't use the the shower gel, it is so greasy, couldn't take it off, very low quality products. Very cold as well, it took ages to warm up after we called the reception, we couldn't turn the aircon heat on ourselves as it didn't work.
The room had a smell. The windows are not clean. The photos are showing a decent room, but the reality is not the same.
Staff were ok, is not their fault, is the owner's fault. Breakfast acceptable, minimum basic. 
I will not return to this hotel."
1,Location next to early court tube is about 2 mins walk,Filthy rooms. Room one doesn’t have a window and is a dungeon next to the staff quarters. Worst room I’ve ever had.
2,Easy access to underground,"The room is not clean enough, it is full of dust
I don't understand why they make us beg for shampoo and shower gel
Only one slow elevator
Old and outdated room
Very small reception area
After my free cancellation period ended, I saw that the room rates were reduced and I did not like it"
4,The location and available places to eat.,The staff at reception were quite unfriendly when we arrived. Even staff between themselves were untrustworthy of each other which is very bad to see for customers. Arrived for breakfast just after 9am and it seemed very empty.
1,It was quiet.,"The basement room was not only miles away from what was advertised, but it was grimy and dirty and had an unwelcoming smell."
1,Position,"Very dirty hotel, felt very uncomfortable and I wasn’t able to sleep due to smell of mould and dust."
6,It was near tube station,"Our room 03 was in the basement so had no view at all. 
Trim around the shower screen was dirty"
2,Good location,"Receptionist on phone liking messages when I arrived, requested robes in room, weren’t there. Fruit platter I paid an upgrade for was two apples. Requested Prosecco in room, was left in the with no ice. Blood on duvet (have photos) food very poor quality. Really upset in general. As an influencer I’m lucky enough to stay in a lot of hotels, this was by fa one of the worst."
5,Staff were lovely,"Bed was dressed as double I booked a twin. Beds were lumpy, no cushions or bedspreads on it, no extra pillows blankets if required. Window was faulty. Bedroom lights only switched off if we removed car from wall so had to use bathroom in the dark. Breakfast was very poor. Hotel is rated luxury 4 star, I've stayed in far supplier 3 star hotels"
2,location was good,"my room wasn’t cleaned , the gym was left open and was right above my head and used until i complained at1am the halls were filthy, the lights were so dim i couldn’t see and the choice of room service was curry…"
6,"Location just out of Earl’s Court underground, staff is kind and available, luggage storage","Poor cleaning, small room, old furniture/design"
2,Location,Cleanliness. The stuffy rooms. It was old tatty and dirty.
5,"Location was ok. Good access to Tube. 
The fruit on the first day was nice. But did not come everyday. 
Allowed us to check in early.",Mattress was horrible. Very saggy. Couldn’t sleep well. Not enough space to store clothes away. Lived out of my suitcase. Bathroom tiny with no room to unpack toiletries for two people.
3,In general good but for hotel 2 stars never for hotel 4 stars,"The room very small and they gave me one room when i arrived which was worse .then they cj’hange it after my insisting , the curtain was full of dust and when i tried to open it fell down , very old hotel , you can hear all your neighbors talking , walking . 
Rate one to 2 stars max"
1,Nothing,"Not a great hotel,, very old & small, narrow"
2,"The staff we're friendly and polite. 

Two minute walk from the tube.

Clean & Tidy Hallways. 

Quiet.","Tired room
Faulty bed
Taps missing their hot/cold signs
Torn chair
Dated decoration 
Balcony in a poor state of decoration and broken glass to the side
Dinner was absurd (disgustingly disappointing) 
Noisy Aircon"
6,"The look and feel of the hotel was pleasant. 
Showers were great. Choice of shower head or rainfall.
 Reception and restaurant staff friendly. Especially Anna. 
Great location for exploring the city. Super accessible to Tube.","The beds were most uncomfortable, we didn't sleep particularly well. We are used to king-size beds in other locations that we stay in as standard, but these beds are just too small. Rooms quite pokey too. Hubby is 6'4"" so need some wiggle room!! 

The corridors and hallways to room were a bit dreary, dark and dull, and could have used a bit of a refurb. 

Issue with food in the restaurant, but the hotel staff were very pleasant and did all they could to remedy, swiftly. Otherwise tasty with an Asian twist. 

Breakfast is a bit lacking. I'm Not a usual eggs and bread and meat person, prefer better quality protein based options, and much more fresh fruit selection. Plus alternative milk/yogurt options would be a more modern approach to Dining guests in this day and age, particularly in London. 

Thank you."
2,The location was good but the hotel was in very poor condition.,My first night was in a tiny room where the backing curtains were full of mould and now I have bronchial asthma from that. I moved to a bigger room for the last two nights which was much better although TV remote did not work nor did the hairdryer. Also I had put a couple of items in the safe which then would not open and they had to send someone to open the safe for me!!
4,"I booked a room with 2 single beds, but all they had was a room with a double bed.",Provide me with what I booked
1,ABSOLUTLY NOTHING,"The worst hotel I have ever booked to stay in. Did not stay even one night and they refused to provide a full refund despite Booking .com being in agreement. The superior double room was in a basement that felt like a dungeon. Hallways were dirty, the staff not helpful. They did not help us with our bags when we arrived for check in despite 3 or 4 staff standing around and no one helped us on taking our bags down the flights of stars to view the room they were going to put us in. Having this hotel as a choice on your website diminishes my respect for your website. I would have expected Booking.com to support us in obtaining a full refund but instead we were told by you that it was up to the hotel to provide a full refund and the hotel said it was up to you people to assist us in getting a full refund. We are not very happy with this experience to say the least."
1,Nothing,Was robbed my hotel wanted to cancel 2 months in advance a third night I now didn’t need they weren’t interested in helping out just take your money. Distrusting then asked to leave a good review after all that. No chance of that happening
5,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Their was a loud noise coming from bathroom pipes..like a kango hammer..all night both nights, I asked them to sort it on Saturday, they didn't. I'm getting on a plane now to go home very tired from no sleep,it ruined our weekend 😓"
4,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,The bed not comfortable was a double room but two single beds put together and could feel the ends of the mattress digging into back. Could hear external noise from other guests woken up in the middle of the night multiple times.
4,Location,Our air conditioner did not work properly for 2 days even after asking for maintenance personnel to check. We also asked for a fan since the AC was not working but never received it.
2,"The room allocated to us was in the basement with no window or natural light. It was like being in a dungeon! The cost of the room was excessive for being in such a room. The facilities were poor, the coffee was in instant packets, I would have at lease expected a Nespresso machine given the price of the room.","The room. Being in a dungeon, the facilities."
5,fine for a standard room with no frills.,room smelt of damp. bed was quite small and a spring stabbed me.
1,The location was close to Earls Court Station,"Bed was very uncomfortable, hotel was noisy with very thin walls, they started vacuuming at 8am, and after agreeing to hold our bags for a few days (between stays with this hotel) and tagging them they then chased us down the road having changed their mind. We were on our way to the train station to leave for our honeymoon."
5,Did not have it,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
3,Location,"Thought the hotel was dirty and extremely dusty! Hotel facilities were extremely poor. A dirty couch to sit on in the foyer was about the height of it. 

I asked reception was there any patisseries close by. To which they answered no. There were two at the top of the street!"
4,Not a lot unfortunately.,"Dirty “superior” room was actually in the basement with no window, poorly designed with an uncomfortable bed and lights in the ceiling that couldn’t be turned off. Staff came and taped over them. Wifi didn’t work at all, carpets so uneven in the hallways I saw several people trip over them. Do yourself a favour and don’t stay here."
5,Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. Fruit to welcome in the room,"Really disappointed that we didn't have a window 😕 our room was booked months in advance so couldn't understand why we were stuck downstairs in Room 1. There was no warning of this snd we both felt quite claustrophobic! It was noisy too, think the cleaners had a room down there?
We were going to complain but we knew the hotel was full. Not sure we would recommend this hotel to be honest."
3,"Breakfast was good. The pervading smell of air freshener and lack of fresh air were particularly off-putting. The entire place felt stale. 
The fridge in the room didn’t work.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
4,Location is great,"Rooms were extremely small with a small double bed and aircon that was all but non existent.

Expensive for what you get"
6,"Location is great, bus station and Underground is too close , good restaurant variation around","Clean is too poor, shampoo quality is so cheap"
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Room called Superior but in fact small and most uncomfortable' Large bed but otherwise very little space.
Bathroom ditto"
1,The worst hotel ever - front of house staff ok but the management are awful,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
3,The location was perfect and the staff attentive.,The curtains in my room were mouldy I had to make three complaints at three different times before they were changed. The carpet in the corridor outside my room was dirty.
4,Room we were given on the second night of our stay,"Room we were given on the first night of our stay. I would compare it to an underground bunker, no window or natural light or ventilation."
2,Location was centra. pretty much nothing about home. Disappointed,The Bedroom was extremely small. There was no storage for clothes apart from hanging space and we had to move out of one another's way to pass in the room.The worst hotel i have stayed in London. Embarrassing as my cousin was travelling with me
5,location,"dirty towels
tired looking property
uncomfortable bed"
5,"Location, access to public transport (Earls Court Tube Stn), a wide selection of nearby restaurants, wi-fi was excellent for streaming, pleasant and attentive staff.","Room was too small and claustrophobic - very easily cluttered due to space being at a premium, especially if you have a fair amount of kit
View from my room (218) not great...looked out onto the backs/fire escapes of adjacent buildings. 
Tea/coffee equipment and condiments were incorporated into the wardrobe, thereby limiting available wardrobe space.
Work table was too small - could not conveniently use my laptop and work files at the same time...no chair, only a stool which was uncomfortable for long term use.
Breakfast queue was too long - waited 15 mins for a table before having to leave and got a McDonald's breakfast instead."
1,nothing,"not clean, no hot water on the day we were leaving. No one informed of not having hot water till we woke up at 4.00 am to get ready to catch a train to York. The staff did have any authority to get down a manger to fix the issue. There was no duty manger nor a maintenance guy this property being a 4 star hotel ??? The guys at the reception desk did not have the experience to help customers. All gusts leaving early morning had to go without a wash or having a shower. The front desk said they cannot do anything till 9.00 am."
5,Close to Tube,Room was damp and musty and dusty; property showed aging; bed was too small and uncomfortable
1,"didn’t like anything!!! I was moved from this hotel last minute. ruined all my plans. they got me to another hotel which was dated, room was tiny and far from my meetings at Cromwell hospital",it costs me so much in taxis going back and forth
1,the entrance,the rugs were dirty there was also drilling and I was out to stay in the basements where the other staff stayed the pillows on the bed was old and dirty and when I brought the fact that that was not the room I payed for to the receptionist she responded by saying that it was the best room. I feel profiled I was the only guest that stayed in the basement which seems to be where the staff lives the rugs are moldy
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Tired looking room. Carpet was grubby. 
Sink leaked. No water on the first night of our stay from 10.30pm.
We paid for the hotel location, NOT the quality!!"
5,Staff friendly and helpful,"The stairs and finding my room and reception was complicated. The bed was very uncomfortable, the charging outlet was difficult to use, I had to ask where the outlet was, it was hidden behind the side table."
3,Good location and decent price.,"Bed was 2 singles pushed together, not a double as advertised and very uncomfortable. Room wasn't sound proofed and bed had small red stain on it."
1,The Room was decent.,"Noise. Extremely loud, shouting, laughing, screaming, banging guests until 4am. Reported to reception on two occasions during the night, and they said they contacted the guests and they were quiet for about 20mins and then started again.

Then to top it all off, at 6.30am the cleaners decided they would have full blown conversations and cracking jokes with each other at full volume in the corridor."
6,Polite & respectful Staff.,The shower had black Mold in it. I was disgusted.
6,Good location near underground station,"Room temperature. It was very cold. At night I put my winter coat over the duvet to keep warm. I understand that room rates have gone up, because the costs of heating have gone up. But then, if hotels switch off the heating, this seems unfair."
1,almost nothing,"i have found a thief in my room while coming back from outside, the same has happened to other 2 couples on the same night"
1,The location was good.,"The room was in a basement with no day light, it was stuffy and just felt awful."
1,The location was nice,The room stunk of cigarette smoke. The light sequence and configuration was confused and to top it off I left my watch bracelet and ring in the room on check out only to be told that no items were found by housekeeping. I distinctly recall where I left them. The room was checked prior to any other occupant entering the room. I hate making unfounded accusations but something about this whole situation didn’t sit well. These items were of high sentimental value to me. The hotel took zero responsibility and offered no form of reparation. Even a small gesture like a 10% discount on the bill or some other nominal goodwill gesture would have gone a long way.
3,location,"no overnight luggage storage, even if you are coming back with a reservation."
5,location,"hotel buidling, dingy pathways, dark corridoors, small rooms"
5,location. very convenient public transportation,"room was max. 3-star. Staff on arrival were very nice but experience at checking out was so disappointing. No over night luggage storage even if you are coming back, which was such a ‘surprise’ among all the hotels I stayed with worldwide."
1,Breakfast was good,The way they gave us a very bad room in the start and we had to complain to get a right room
5,looks good from outside,cleaning issues
1,The bathroom although it was cold,"Not value for money, overpriced, small rooms, tired fittings"
4,Location,"Adter a night out, we came back to a smoke-filled room. We had to move to a different room. The room we moved to was so noisy. A door was banging from the staff housekeeping room opposite."
1,My partner ! This is the only thing that saved it .,"£227 for one night . Total rip-off for what u get. to go to the room (which was in the basement area ) we had to walk down a set of stairs with a super dirty carpet and terrible smell of cigarettes .
There were only two medium size poor quality bath towels . Stains on the curtains . No complimentary water . Window overlooking the air-con units and other walls . The staff uniforms
( reception , restaurant, etc) looked old and tired. Even more disappointing considering that at the chucking the told me we had been upgraded to a superior room! What a joke !"
1,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,2 o’clock in the morning we had to move to another because the room didn’t have a hot water.
3,Close-ish to the Natural History Museum.,Basement room with no windows (aka r#p& dungeon 💩)!!!! Bowl shaped bed of doom (torture rack?)... Noisy air-conditioning unit. Thin walls and screaming kids. Horrible super bright white hospital lighting... It just goes on and on!
3,"Breakfast was just ok. Service was fine but food was below average. Nice waiters and helpful waiters and front desk. Hotel location was great for getting to subway station. Felt safe! Many restaurants close by. Hotel was very dated! Clean but not above average. Bathroom very small! Beds were either too hard or sagged! Pillows were horrible, hard as rocks! Sheets were very scratchy!!!! Elevator extremely small and very slow!!!!!! Would not stay again though the staff were great!",Very dated. Not up to my standards! Beds were terrible! Food just ok. Loud noise in our room so had to move. Air conditioning was difficult to use.
1,Nothing,"It is old and low budget. Old room with very old and cheap beds.
Very desapointing"
6,I liked the staff. Everyone was very helpful and caring,"The hotel has rooms located in the basement and sub basement. This was a terrible experience. We asked to be moved from the -2 level to above the ground and we were accommodated. The hallways unfortunately smelled of some food and had very little air movement in them, so the hotel has stagnant smells that are never aired."
4,"Great location, close to the underground. Very convenient","Wi-Fi doesn’t work, was put in a room underground with no phone coverage."
1,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Worst stay ever. The staff was rude , i asked for room.service in the morning and their answer was that they were too busy with breakfast and noone coule help me. Rooms were dirty."
1,"I would like to request a full refund. The staff was extremely rude and inattentive responding to my room key not working multiple occasions, including one where I had to wait for 30 minutes late at night to get into the room. I did not end up staying at the property for the night.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
3,"The location is good, easy access to the tube.","Our room was literally in a basement. We had to go into the building, go up in the lift and then go down these back alley stairs. We got back to the hotel at about 10pm, went to our dodgy back alley stairs and there were doors wide open leading directly outside. I stayed with my wife and under no circumstances would I feel comfortable her walking around by herself. And our view.... literally a pigeon park. Our window looked out onto the back of another building, covered in pipes and surrounded by pigeons.
The hallways are disgusting, dirty and ripped carpets. The walls are disgusting.
Never ever staying here again."
6,"The staff were great - all very accommodating and helpful. I was told I was given a free upgrade for my room which was a lovely surprise. The hotel lobby was nice, as was the restaurant for breakfast. Breakfast was comprehensive and tasty. The room was quite large and had plenty of space for storage. The location of the hotel is brilliant - just a 2 minute walk from the underground station. 
The area was quiet at night. 
The high street is a 2 minute walk away with plenty of shops nearby.","The room was dated and there were various bits of damage e.g. paint peeling and plug sockets not working. The remote to the TV didn't work all that well and took a few attempts to change the channel.
The beds were soft but incredibly uncomfortable to sleep on - I got a backache from the bed!
The air conditioning system was terrible. The room was always too cold or too hot. It was impossible to get the temperature right.
The shower was tiny and leaked water all over the already very cramped bathroom."
2,location was convenient,"the first night we were given a dingy basement room. The next three nights a room that used two single beds pushed together as a luxury double room. The property was tired and scruffy, much like a hostel with expensive hotel prices."
1,The location - if your are looking for shopping and eateries - this was a good location,"Booked a Superior double room and got a room in the basement with no telephone connection and the A/C vents blowing straight to the pillows. When my telephone showed no service, I first thought my Sim card crashed.. but upon reaching the reception the next morning, I could see the connection back on my phone. That's when I realized that the room was beyond the reach of mobile telephone signals. 
Was not able to sleep due to the A/C hitting directly in my face.
Since it was only for a night, I did not mind when I was taken to the basement room at check in - I planned to come late at night, sleep and check out next morning...however, sleeping was a problem due to the A/c (found out late at night when we returned after shopping/dinner) and then found out mobile signals were not available in the room. It was the last day of our 10 day UK trip and this was the only blip... never again will I return to this hotel."
5,location was good,"it was dirty. 
no underlay on the bed
threadbare fraying bath towels"
1,"not a lot really, the hotel is apparently 4 star, the welcome area was the only clean thing about the property, our room was underground and absolutely vile, stains on the walls, dead flies on the window that opened to a brick wall, table was dirty, scuff marks everywhere, I was throughly disappoint as I had booked this for my partners birthday expecting a really lovely hotel, the hotel offered me a complimentary nights stay however that is not good enough, when you pay for 4* you expect 4 star but the hotel will refuse to even reimburse half of the stay, I certainly wouldn’t recommend it. I have all the photos of the dirt etc and have shared them with booking.com.

I still expect the hotel to come to a resolution with me on this so I look forward to hearing from you.","Quite a lot really, the hotel is apparently 4 star, the welcome area was the only clean thing about the property, our room was underground and absolutely vile, stains on the walls, dead flies on the window that opened to a brick wall, table was dirty, scuff marks everywhere, I was throughly disappoint as I had booked this for my partners birthday expecting a really lovely hotel, the hotel offered me a complimentary nights stay however that is not good enough, when you pay for 4* you expect 4 star but the hotel will refuse to even reimburse half of the stay, I certainly wouldn’t recommend it.

1,Close to the station with good access to Heathrow airport.,"My room was a dungeon. It had no windows, was very dark, and smelled of damp. I asked about changing but they had no other options. 
It wasn’t a king bed like I paid for, it was two different height beds pushed together. 
Dirty room - dusty, stains on sheets and towels. 
Very overpriced considering the quality of the stay."
1,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,lack of cleanliness and attention to customer
4,Location is amazing.,"Offered upgrade upon arrival. Room was slightly bigger but in basement with no windows! No thanks. Also the surprise holding fee of the total bill before we checked in! Essentially paying double and then they cancel the holding payment after you check out. This may take up to 10 days. Absolutely shambolic.
Wouldn't stay again as its really 2/3 star max. Curtains ripped, can't open balcony windows and had to ask for bath towels, not just hand towels that were supposed to dry our bodies and hair with. Shower excellent but suffers from drainage issue."
6,The location and the staff.,"The beds were small, the toilets were very small and the rooms did not get cleaned on daily basis."
5,"The aircon and cleaning was very good and nice. The cleaner- Euanna, supply water, towel and cleaned every day. The fridge was good cooling but too small.","The beds were uncomfortable. I complaind by front desk to Mr. Arvi, with a promise to pass it to the manager but nothing was done. The water in the shower was greasy. Impossible to wash away properly the soap/shampoo 
No parking. We got 2 parking tickets in one day with the disable badge...it's different rools in this area.....my husband had to park far away, to walk back and change the parking after 3 hours. So basically every 2 hours he had to walk to move the car and find a different parking. 
Very disappointed. We leave in London we didn't want to drive far away, came to rest but went home teird. We paid a lot of money for 4 nights. We could sleep at home, save this money, travel every day to a different destination And enjoy. We are very disappointed. Sorry about that but we didn't enjoy it. Sofi Einigher"
5,The restaurant attached to the hotel was very good.,"We were put in a downstairs room that shouldn't have been in use, it was like a dungeon. The sheets didn't fit the bed, a single continental quilt was put into a king size cover so only one person was warm. The bed was against a wall so only one person could get out of bed easily. The lights didn't work properly, it was dark because the window was 10ft in the air, filthy and shaded by the building. The shower flooded and the towels were dirty.
We moved after 2 nights to an upper floor which was far better, the towels were still dirty though. Its just a chaotic hotel. The fire hose was blocked with mattresses being stored, totally illegal! A total shambles of a place."
4,staff where friendly,"room was in a basement, no window, no shower gel, no remote for TV, room was very small including bathroom"
1,location,not clean and old furniture
5,"the location is very good , the price was reasonable","only one person in the recption his name is Wahi who was so ftoans helpful, we had a lot of issues regarding the cleaning service and explaining with the staff"
5,close to train.,"The cover on the foot of the bed was dirty, desk light didn’t work. Hallways narrow & not well lit."
1,"On 24/06/22. I booked a two-night stay in your hotel for my sister for a birth treat, somewhere to get away to and I thought Park Grand was the perfect place, as the time progressed I would call to get an update, but most of the time I called is even they could find my confirmation or reservations number and I am always getting some story or other. On 22/07/22 my sist.er arrived at your property and booked in from the moment she gets to Ty he took she started calling to say the room is not decorated as promised for her birth, I did make it clear, that it was a birthday treat. My sister did call the reception and she was told that the housekeeper should have done it but they don't know why it has been done.. However, my sister was asked to leave the room, she waited in the lobby for twenty minutes whild the housekeeper went and decorated the room and that was very, but as a matter of fact, the joy and the surprise were already taken out of her stay. Because of the joy of it, she should have opened that door and been surprised by what was on the inside. I must also say because it was a treat I per pay for the breakfast and dinner for two on 23/07/22 and breakfast for two on 24/07/22 which they didn't have breakfast, because they leave the hotel very early this morning. However, after my card was charged for the dinner and breakfast they went and charge my sister's card this morning my sister related to me that her stay was more hassle than anything else and it make me feel very sad and disappointed for her because I get her away from her place of living to get this peaceful time and she came back telling me the bad experiences she encounter.",My sister didn't like the bad experience she have to encounter over something that did already pay for.
1,The location was good and the staff were friendly.,"We booked the hotel but ended up in a basement room, the A/c didn't for better part of the day and finally room smelt of weed."
1,Nothing,"Everything. We had no plug sockets working, beds were most uncomfortable I’ve ever slept in, pillows were rocks, bedside lamps wouldn’t turn off as switches didn’t work so had to remove bulbs, fridge/AC was grinding most of the night, TV didn’t work…"
3,"The location of the hotel is good with tube station nearby and all the amenities, restaurants and bars of Earls Court and Kensington a short walk away.","This is not a 4 star hotel. Check in was easy until I started being directed to my room in the basement. I asked if the room had a window and was told it did but the window didn't open. I was quickly allocated a different room with a window that opened but also in the basement. I was told I would need to be taken to the room otherwise I would never find it which started to ring alarm bells. As I was guided up stairs and along several corridors and down some more stairs, the receptionist enthused at how much I would like my room as it was much nicer than the original one allocated to me. As we descended the stairs into the basement, the condition of the decor became visibly worse and it was very obvious my room was not in the main part of the hotel. The room was awful; located next to a staff and delivery entrance and a fire door in the corridor that woke me up every time someone opened and closed it. The room smelt of damp and was filthy. The furnishings were dated and worn and I was just grateful I had lots planned so would be spending as little time in the room over my 3 night stay as possible. The bed was uncomfortable with a worn mattress and terrible pillows. Although I had breakfast included I decided against it after looking through the glass doors into the dreary and dated dining room. Overall a pretty terrible experience."
1,NOTHING.,THE ROOM HAS NO WINDOWS. The photos of the room is misleading.
2,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Upon check in, the initial room we were placed into was not the room size that was reserved. When this was mentioned to the staff, they gave the impression hey were doing a favor to move us to a larger room. We were instructed that we should leave our bags in the room and they would move the bags on our behalf. My companion inadvertently left an outfit in the closet. When she remembered and contacted the front desk, the room was occupied. My companion had to follow-up with the front desk regarding the status of locating the outfit. When the front desk finally followed-up, she was told the guest occupying indicated there wasn't an outfit in the closet and there was nothing that could be done. 
The room very small....it really is only large enough for one person..... There isn't any room in the bathroom. The drain sink for the shower is in the middle of the shower. The shower mat that was provided was filthy. Had to request a new one. In the middle of our final night, the toilet started running after it was flushed and it wouldn't stop. Meaning, it couldn't be used. When I called the front desk, a staff person came up to the room and could not fix the issue. He indicated that they would send someone up when the maintenance staff arrived at 8 am. I advised that we were checking out and needed to shower and use the restroom. I had to ask if there was another room that could be used due to broken toilet, they returned with keys to a room on the 5th floor and we were on the 1st floor. Spoke with a manager upon check out who indicated they would follow-up with Booking.com who in turn would follow-up with me. I received an email indicated they would provide a credit due to the inconvenience. The only good thing I would say is the location. It was only about 5 minutes to the underground train station."
5,"Reception staff lovely and helpful on check-in today l, especially a lady called Anna.

Decent size bed and room.","Really hot day / night and the AC didn't work at all in my room. Made a complaint in person on the night twice and on the phone once. Issue could not be resolved and manager nowhere to be seen. They'd got other rooms available for the same night online, however, I was not offered this as an option. So hot and so uncomfortable without AC. A standard hotel room requirement, especially at £288 per room per night. Not impressed."
3,Staff were great,"I was allocated a room in the 'dungeon', totally underground with no natural light. If they're going to allocate such a room to a guest it should be disclosed to them so that they can make an informed choice.
Check in was only available late in the afternoon as linen supplies were delayed"
2,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Over priced, was unclean"
1,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"I don't understand how this is a 4 star hotel. Not worth the cost, spend your money elsewhere. Toilet was dirty when we walked in, hair on pillowcases, the bathroom sink didn't drain properly and filled up with water when washing hands and brushing teeth. When I contacted booking.com customer service to file a complaint, the hotel called me directly and asked if I had any photos. This was a short stay for an overnight layover - after an exhausting day of travel and arriving late then leaving early I had no time to think to take photos. We did call to have new pillowcases so there should be record of that, and the new ones provided also were not clean we had to ask a second time. In regards to the sink I told them to go into the room and check the sink themselves for evidence of it not draining properly. Also, if I'm walking into the bathroom and open the toilet lid and there's remnants of poop in it, my first instinct is to flush immediately. Not go grab my phone and take a photo. The hotel denied my request for any sort of compensation. Waste of money."
5,Good location,"Bed was very uncomfortable and no natural light in the room making it feel very dark
Cooked breakfast was cold"
6,location is perfect! near tube station,very small rooms & beds.
5,"Convenient location, gentle staff.","Poor quality food and assortment at breakfast, room not so clean"
3,The position is excellent and the hotel is relatively quiet.,"Everything in the room is old and not well maintained. Cleanliness leaves a lot to desire. Even though we booked a ""deluxe"" double room, they gave us an underground room with no wi-fi and no room for the luggage."
3,The team working were all friendly.,Generally dirty around the hotel. Carpets and walls etc. Everything was very worn out and tired.
2,Only the location was good.,"Booked a room with a window. To reach the room, we had to go 2 floors down by stairs, so we technically were in a basement. It did have a window through which you could not see the sky, only a sunless, dirty and small inner ""courtyard"".

Room had no natural light and smelled like humidity. You could hear everything happening in the rooms next door and in the hallway.

The bed had a hughe (and I mean hughe) bump. Asked for it to be replaced at 9 AM. By the tame we got back at 17.30 they still hadn't done it. Had to wait 25 minutes in the lobby."
3,nothing,smelly rooms with dirty carpets. mold in the shower room. very small rooms. dated furniture and sagging mattresses. we were stuck because we had confirmed reservations through booking.Com. we also had another confirmed reservation for two rooms from 9-12 June. but the hotel cancelled our reservation citing issues with charging credit card. booking.Com also did not help. I used the same credit card to book Marriott nearby thru booking.Com so clearly the issue is with hotel which cancels earlier lower priced reservations to get new booking at higher prices. it’s a scam which booking.Com must look into.

there was banging in the middle of the night for a long time and then shouts
when went downstairs in the middle of the night (3am) there was nobody at the reception but the door was unlocked, meaning that people shouting in the street could easily come inside whenever. GENEREALLY DIDNT FEEL VERY SAFE, ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO THE PRICE OF £172"
5,it had a good shower,"first room we were in had unclean bed sheets and Hairs in the bed and stained carpet, second room had a faulty spotlight when dimmed, staff didn’t really seem to bothered by it either, also there was no window in the second room!"
5,Staff are very pleasant but that is all that is good about this hotel.,"It is not 4star. All corridors etc very tired, it looks like it needs a complete decoration. We returned to the room one day about 14.00 hrs, room still not cleaned. All areas; lots of hand marks etc. room very small, net curtains do not fit the size of the window. Room largely clean but simply not worth the money we paid. Parking is a real problem, we drove to a number of different places to find a space."
4,"The location was excellent, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.","Our room was dark and in the basement. You had to go down a labyrinth of hallways (including one that reeked of smoke) in order to get to the room. The room was VERY small. If you think you're getting a room like the one that's pictured on Booking.com, you will be extremely disappointed. It felt like a bait and switch. The shower was terrible, no water pressure at all. The towels were generously sized, but smelled like smoke and cooking grease. Bits of things kept falling off in the room, like the wall hook for the hair dryer and some small metal piece on the shower control. When we got to the room, it was very cold. We turned on the heat and nothing happened, and as a matter of fact it seemed to get colder. We finally called the front desk, and they said ""Oh, we'll turn on the heat in your room."" You would think that they would have done that when we arrived. After that though, we were able to control the temperature in the room to our satisfaction. There were plenty of toiletries in the room, but only 2 half-used toilet paper rolls. That felt tacky and cheap to us. There was a small microwave (which we did not try) and a mini-fridge that was lukewarm and had no controls to make it colder."
2,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,too small
1,it looked good and the website states it is 4 star,"it was the standard of a 2-3 star hotel, didn’t inform us of breakfast times and they had no room service and rooms were dirty"
1,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,For 213£ I got a so-called superior double room - turned out to be a small room in the basement with a tiny window and extensive noise most of the night. Didn’t get any sleep…
4,Staff friendly and helpful.,"Room very small; had to edge around the bed to access the wardrobe. Sink in bathroom, though trendy was useless. Mould on bathroom tiles and around shower base. No chair in room, only a dressing table stool."
1,the reception,"it wasn’t clean, the staff were rude and unhelpful, the room was dark and had no natural light"
1,Very little,"A lot. State of the rooms, ability to maintain a good temperature given the cold. Broken windows. Broken telephones. Dirty laundry bags. Broken gym equipment. Very cold beds due to thin duvets and no bed covers. Broken mattresses in the corridors."
6,Room is 5 starts decorated but extremely small. Hardly room to move around.,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
1,"Paid for an upgraded room, ended up with a basement room, NOTHING LIKE WHAT I PAID FOR!!!!!! Towels not changed, tea coffee not replenished, bed had more lumps and bumps than the M25, bathroom taps looked disgusting. View from the window was a 15 foot high wall.see photos of tap and window view...","All of it, next time I'll use premium in, a third of the cost and a lot better service/ value."
3,Not very much,"The staff were unhelpful, bordering rude. Did not help when I had to get an urgent trip to accident and emergency in Chelsea, with a broken ankle. No good provided, nothing. Ordered me a taxi, which you would think, being in so much pain, the hotel would have covered...they didn't.
Disrespectful staff. Put on the lowest floor possible, no natural light, tripped down the stairs etc etc. Would expect a full refund."
4,The location was good,I was put in a dungeon room with no windows. Generally it was a very tired facility that urgently needed a revamp
2,nothing,"dirty and grubby. poor drainage in shower and loo, dirt and rubbish under the bed. hideously uncomfortable, ridiculously soft double bed, which was two single beds !"
5,Reception area and location. Air conditioned room,"Room 307, 2 single beds pushed together with different mattresses making it impossible to sleep across the 2 so may aswell had a single bed. 
No smart TV in rooms 
Breakfast time not early enough starting at 7am"
1,Breakfast was good. There was a wide selection of food.,"My husband found dried blood on his towel when he was using it after his shower. I immediately checked the second towel and found there to be make up on the towel. Although the towels were folded and looked clean they had not been washed. I immediately took both towels to Reception and spoke to the Manager on Duty, Mr Dario who tried to argue that the towels were in fact clean. He said he would email the company they used for their laundry and start an investigation and email me with an update. This was a month ago and still today I have not heard from him. The Management had no interest in addressing the issue.
There was also dried urine on the inside of the toilet seat. THIS HOTEL IS DIRTY which would be bad enough at any time but shocking during a pandemic. 
Our room was also windowless. How could Booking.com rate a Hotel that sells rooms without windows and does not inform the guest on their site, as a four star hotel?"
1,Bathrooms were quite clean. Receptionists helpful- they managed to move us to a bigger bed the second night.,"Tiny bed, super hot duvet, air con didn’t do anything. Everything felt sticky. White powder in phones? Teabag stuck to ceiling light but obviously no one had noticed. One of our rooms stank of smoke. Very strong smell of cannabis in the hotel corridor both nights. One member of staff seemed very up and down- delighted to see us one minute then almost angry with us the next- whether it was because we weren’t happy with our rooms and asked to change, I don’t know- but my children and I found it very unsettling."
6,good and friendly reception staff,"housekeeping were bad,stairs and hallways need new carpet and wallpaper (whole hotel needs a refurb),very small rooms and a deluxe double room was 2 single beds pushed together and very uncomfortable ...NOT A DOUBLE BED"
6,"+ Great location!
+ The staff went out of their way to set up a birthday surprise in our room which was super cute!!","- Double bed was actually two single beds pushed together with some hard metal in the middle, not very comfortable
- trouble coordinating on cleaning our room"
4,"The reception was beautiful 
staff had excellent customer service and very helpful","The cleanliness of the hotel room I had stayed in was very poor I found dead fly on my pillow and more in the bathroom I’m concerned where they will be coming from as this room had no window. had no service whilst I was staying there. 

The room was extremely dusty and had a horrible smell to it ."

2,really nothing,"1) Room was bad, basement two, no windows, fire safety hazard, corridor carpet was mouldy, no elevator, we have to carry our bog luggage to basement two. 
2) Indian duty manager kept arguing with me the room was good and it is safe, how could the hotel room be in basement two, with no windows, I cannot imagine what would happen iff there is a fire. He also threatens not to refund me the balance. I told the reception I will try to stay for one night and she agreed, she wish to room move me the next day but I told her we will see what happens, this was the agreement when I gave her my credit card. The Indian manager has other ideas.
3) Breakfast was so-so, food not hot, and empty dishes not replenished.
4)Wifi non existent, basement two again.
Just returned me my second night room charge and the extra amount you took for my stay.

1,"NOTHING, as I could not stay!","This is one of the worst experience I ever had a booking with Booking.com. For some reason, I did not stay in the hotel and I could not cancel as somehow I thought I canceled all my bookings. That's my bad. I understand! What is worst is that the hotel has charged all the three days stay. Usually, the first day stay is charged. More importantly, I could have cancelled if there were any notification of the stay from booking.com. I have been trying to contact the property but with no success. At least, I should get an invoice? This is certainly an exploitation of 'such' app services. The burden is passed to the vendor and user."

3,"Reasonably clean room, staff reasonably helpful.","When checked in, was shown to a room in the basement with no natural light. this is supposed to be a four star hotel. the corridor to get there was filthy - it was a fire escape.

3,"the property is in a good location allowing exploration of Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster",we were put into a tiny room that was part of the old building next door the net curtains looked like they had been up as long as the building and the floorboards creaked loudly when someone moved in the next room. In the room itself the air conditioning and the fridge did not work and the drains in the bathroom were clogged so they took forever to drain. The staff weren’t rude but they certainly were not welcoming to be honest I would’ve been better booking a travel lodge

6,location: proximity to tube station - Piccadilly line direct to Heathrow Airport then walking distance to hotel on Hogarth Rd.,"This property is in desperate need of several updates and is not a 4 star property! There was full grown MOLD in the bathroom, plus no ventilation, and clogged drains, cracked ceiling walls that was patched and very visible to the eyes across entire room, old OLd dingy carpets and furniture, old and worn beds with dips and bumps, NOISY thin walls and very Noisy air conditioner vents, loud and noisy maids from the hall ways, my room phone was not working in the room, took 24 hrs to fix, the gym is like dungeon with equipment, I went back to my room to attempt my workout instead. I had to keep going up and downstairs cos keycards use old tech and stopped working several times, so much much more! They try to compensate for this lowly maintained hotel by giving guests goodies on Arrival, nice but don’t, use the money instead to update this hotel, not 4 stars at all. You will be paying for access to Earls Court mostly."

A szállodában a személyzet nagyon kedves és figyelmes volt, minden zökkenőmentesen zajlott. Az ágy nagyon kényelmes volt, a WiFi pedig meglepően jól működött, tökéletesen tudtam pl. streamen focimeccset nézni. A reggeli finom és bőséges volt. Semmi hirtelen felmerülő vagy előre nem látott költség nem volt .","A zuhanyban időszakosan volt melegvíz, nem megállapítható módon, hogy mikor van, mikor nincs.

9,"Dieses Hotel war ein richtiger Glücksgriff. Es war unser erstes Mal in London und wir sind durch die Lage auf das Hotel aufmerksam geworden. Das es aber so perfekt liegt, war uns nicht bewusst. Das Zimmer war völlig ausreichend von der Größe für 2 Personen und hat alles was man benötigt. Für Menschen mit einem sehr leichten Schlaf würde ich empfehlen die Fenster über Nacht zu schließen, wenn das Zimmer zur Straße hin gelegen ist. Es ist nur eine ganz leichte Geräuschkulisse, die sich in den Morgenstunden in der Stadt natürlich nicht vermeiden lässt.","Da man etwas angeben muss, der Sessel im Zimmer ist nicht wirklich bequem.

8,"Tiene una buena ubicación en el extremo de la zona 1del metro, lo que le permite considerarse céntrico sin llegar a ser tan caro como los hoteles del pleno centro de Londres. Muy cerca de la parada de metro de Earsl Court con buena comunicación con el centro y el aeropuerto de Heathrow mediante la línea Picadilly. También tiene conexión con la línea District.
El desayuno es abundante (el típico inglés) y bueno, aunque sin mucha variación a lo largo de los días. 
La habitación tiene un tamaño aceptable para lo que suele ser Londres. Además disponía de una pequeña nevera y, lo que es muy importante, de microondas. Esto te permite poder comprar algo de comer o cenar en las tiendas y tomártelo en la habitación si no te apetece comer en un restaurante.","El precio, pero esto no es un problema del hotel. Londres es una ciudad bastante cara y los precios de los hoteles y restaurantes son bastante mayores para un mismo nivel de calidad."
9,"Für Londoner Verhältnisse in dieser Kategorie hervorragend. Freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal. Insgesamt sehr sauber und rein im Zimmer haben allen technischen Einrichtungen ordnungsgemäß funktioniert. 3 Minuten Weg zur Underground Earls Court, 10 Minuten Fußweg zum Kensington Park super.","Das Frühstück ist ok, aber das ist ja Geschmacksache."
8,"Die Lage ist perfekt, Tube Station Earl‘s Court mit guter Anbindung nur wenige Gehminuten entfernt. Auch Restaurants, Pubs uvm. gibt es in der Nähe reichlich.
Das Zimmer war groß und sehr sauber, gute Ausstattung. 
Nach anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten (s.u.) hat es uns gut gefallen und wir kommen gern wieder.","Nach einem etwas chaotischen Check-in bekamen wir ein dunkles Zimmer im verwinkelten Untergeschoss des Hotels zugeteilt. Da wir extra ein „Deluxe“- Zimmer gebucht hatten, waren wir ein wenig enttäuscht und fragten nach einem alternativen Zimmer. Ein Wechsel wurde uns freundlicherweise ermöglicht.
Verwirrung kam auf, da wir bei der Buchung sicher waren, das Frühstück sei inklusive. Leider war das wohl eine Fehlinformation oder ein Missverständnis, sodass wir nochmal extra fürs Frühstück zahlten."

I morgenmadsrestauranten var personalet venlige men ret uorganiserede, hvilket gjorde at der ofte herskede kaotiske tilstande.
Vær opmærksom på, at der ikke kan opbevares bagage på hotellet ved ankomst og afrejse. Det er virkelig irriterende. Det er nødvendigt at betale for at få opbevaret sin bagage ude i byen."

9,Posizione ottima a 2 minuti a piedi dalla metro. La zona è ben fornita sia di bar per far colazione che di ristoranti quindi anche alla sera non è necessario spostarsi con i mezzi. Considerando gli standard di Londra l’albergo è decisamente sopra la media con stanze accoglienti e pulite (cosa non scontata a Londra). Ovviamente la stanza non è grandissima ma è perfettamente vivibile e per gli standard londinesi è comunque buona. Non abbiamo provato la colazione ne il servizio ristorazione che offre l’albergo.

3. Il nostro affaccio era in strada ma attaccata al balconcino della stanza c’è il luogo di deposito dei rifiuti quindi oltre a non essere propriamente panoramico , si sentiva rumore al passaggio del camion dei rifiuti!

Wir haben uns rundum sehr wohl gefühlt.",Es gab etwas wenig Ablagefläche im Bad.
8,Situation calme à proximité des commerces et restaurants.,Rien

Het ontbijt was heel uitgebreid en goed geregeld. 
Het personeel heel vriendelijk en behulpzaam
De kamer was schoon en netjes.","We zaten in een kamer in wat leek, de kelder. We moesten eerst een lange gang door en meerdere deuren om weer een andere gang tegen te komen. Daar rook het erg muffig."

Auch das Zimmer ist sauber mit Klimaanlage und einer schönen Ausstattung.

8,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Aufgrund des Champions League Endspiels an dem Wochenende leider extrem hoher Preis! 1 Nacht 463 € ist einfach nicht gerechtfertigt!! Zu normalen Reisezeiten wäre der normale Tageskurs gut
7,"Das Hotel liegt in der Nähe des U-Bahnhofes Earls Court und damit ist man relativ schnell an jeder Sehenswürdigkeit.
Es liegt in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße. Es gibt ein Frühstücksbuffet.","Das Badezimmer war sehr eng.
Das Frühstücksbuffet hat im Gegensatz zum Vorjahr deutlich weniger Auswahl."
8,Frukosten lite mager.Scrambled eggs lite torra,Sängen för mjuk mot sidorna. Kalldrag från fönstret

8,"bon accueil, cet hôtel est propre, spacieux, bien placé dans la ville et avec un accès facile au métro. La chambre est très calme
Le seul petit bémol est le petit déjeuner, sans boisson au chocolat, manque de fruits, de pain.",rien à signaler.
7,Das Zimmer war O.K.aber erst nach Upgrade.Das Bett war gut. Die Nähe zu der Tubestation Earl's Court.,Das Frühstück entsprach in keiner Hinsicht dem Standard eines continentalen 4Sternehotels. Da bekommt man in einem Garnihotel in Deutschland einen besseres Angebot. Für das Frühstück gibt es nur ein Mangelhaft!!!! Daher stimmt das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis nicht!
7,die Lage und freundliches Personal,"das Frühstück war nicht besonders gut, Kaffee nicht geniessbar, Tee ok, Personal nicht sehr aufmerksam. Es war ausserdem kalt und hat gezogen an unserem Platz, also eher ungemütlich."
9,"Śniadania bardzo smaczne i wystarczające, personel bardzo życzliwy , uprzejmy, okolica przyjemna , czysta .","Mieliśmy lot wieczorem i nie mogliśmy zostawić bagaży w jakimś pomieszczeniu koło recepcji , żeby chociaż pójść na spacer bez bagażu Powiedziano nam że nie nie ma takiej możliwości .

Die Betten sind sehr weich aber das ist Geschmackssache. Auch mit drei Erwachsenen, ist das Zimmer passend.","Wie gesagt,Frühstück für den Preis etwas spärlich.
Sonst kann ich nichts schlechtes sagen."

Camera abbastanza pulita. La pulizia è stata fatta quotidianamente con cambio di asciugamani.",Purtroppo non gradisco la moquette anche se presente quasi in tutti gli hotel.
8,Bra standard. Bra läge. Gång avstånd till London Book Fair,Jag är frustrerad över att någon måste komma med kaffe till dig på frukosten. Det tar så lång tid ibland att jag är klar med frukosten innan jag får mitt kaffe..

Zimmer sehr gut ausgestattet.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
7,Centraal gelegen hotel in Kensington; dichtbij metrostation. Rustige straat. Vriendelijk en behulpzaam personeel.,Badkamer is gedateerd en klein. Geen 4 sterren waardig. Raam in de kamer kan niet open.
8,"Ottima posizione e vicino alla metro. Staff gentile ma non troppo informato, colazione buona ma sopratutto salata. Letto super comodo!","Stanza piccola, pochi ripiani dove appoggiare le cose, ganci per appendere i vestiti inesistenti."
8,Tolles Thai-Restaurant im Hotel! Anbindungen zum Hotel bzw. Zum Flughafen Gatwick sehr gut!,"Frühstück war gut, jedoch nur eine kleine Auswahl."
7,"Hotellin sijainti on hyvä, lähellä metroasema, kuitenkin rauhallisella kadulla; huone oli siisti, perushyvä pienehkö; hotelli tarjoa aamupalaa joka oli riittävä (perusvalikoima kuitenkin).","Palvelu ei vastannut odotuksiin eikä maksettua rahaa- viimeisenä päivänä meidän check out oli 10 min ennen maksetua aamupala alkamista, niin kun kysyin mahdollisuudesta saada kahvia (huom! ei maksettua välipala!) vastauksena tuli, että eivät voi tarjoa vaan voin itse osta kahvin lähikahvilasta…"
9,"Siisti huone ja tilat
erittäin ystävällinen henkilökunta","Hissi oli valitettavasti rikki puolet ajasta.

9,"Sehr freundlicher Empfang, Zimmer für London ausreichend groß und gut gelegen an der Tube.","Frühstück ist im Restaurant des Hotels, gehört allerdings nicht dazu. Zusatzbestellungen wie Kakao müssen beim Frühstück bei jeder Bestellung separat gezahlt werden und es muss direkt unterschrieben werden.

7,Fijne kamers met goede bedden en goed ontbijt. Geweldige locatie.,"Er kon geen enkele raam open, dus beide kamers (naast elkaar) konden nooit gelucht worden (ramen waren met bouten vergrendeld), volgens de technische dienst omdat er iemand een maand eerder uit het raam gesprongen was onder invloed van drugs. Maar op dezelfde verdieping en de verdieping erboven konden de ramen wel open. Dit was dus niet fijn (zeker omdat we verkouden waren)"
8,"Τίμιο ξενοδοχείο με καλή σχέση ποιότητας και τιμής. Το προσωπικό εξυπηρετικό και ευγενικό, το δωμάτιο (deluxe room) καθαρό αλλά σχετικά μικρό με άνετο μπάνιο. Βρίσκεται 2' με τα πόδια μακριά από το μετρό από το οποίο, χωρίς να αλλάξετε τρένο, σε περίπου 15' βρίσκεστε στο κέντρο.",Το πρωινό δεν ήταν κάτι το ιδιαίτερο.
8,"Restaurant 's avonds was leuk en aanbod heel goed, lekker Indisch oa. Personeel receptie mocht wat vriendelijker zijn (dat geldt voor een aantal onder hen)",Lees hierboven. Aanbod horeca in de directe omgeving was niet geweldig. Werd gelukkig gecompenseerd door het aanbod in het restaurant van het hotel.
9,Cama super confortável,"O chuveiro tinha alguma
Coisa que não mantinha fechado e escapava água. Como foi um fim
De semana muito frio o quarto ficou um pouco frio"
9,"La ubicación del hotel estaba muy buena para caminar y recorrer distintos puntos de la ciudad, anteriormente nos alojamos en el sector opuesto y esta ubicación nos permitió recorrer otros puntos","Las alfombras en las habitaciones y en los pasillos, 
ademas del único ascensor y pequeño"
7,Conforto e localização,Funcionário que primeiro atendeu e o fato de não poder deixar bagagem antes check in e depois do check out. Custo vs benefício bem elevado
8,مكان الفندق جيد وقريب على harrods مشيا على الاقدام ونظيف,الغرفه صغيره
7,L'hôtel n'est pas loin du quartier de Chelsea,"Au départ de cet hôtel, ils nous ont refusé la bagagerie et nous ont orienté dans une autre bagagerie payante à 600m. Je trouve que ça n'est pas normal pour un hotel 4*. Nous partions en fin d'après midi, je vous avoue que ça nous a laissé un gout amer."
8,Le calme . Et le personnel très gentil et à l’écoute,"Salle de sport vieillotte, petit déjeuner toujours le même et très peu de fruits et de variété ( pain mou , confiture en barquette trop sucrée….), salle de bain sale et manque de produits pour la douche, chambre assez petite…"
7,Die Lage und das bequeme Bett,"Das kleine Bad
Das beim Frühstück nur Saft, Kaffee, und Tee inklusive war. Cappuccino ect. hätte man bezahlen müssen. Da erwarte ich von einem 4 Sterne Stadthotel mehr.
Eine alte Socke vom Vorgänger lag noch unter einem Nachttisch. Da sollte man zum Check Out die Zimmer genauer anschauen !"
9,Posizione ottima! Metro a meno di 300m,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
8,Vriendelijk personeel en alles was netjes en zag er verzorgd uit. We hadden een kleine kamer geboekt maar kregen gratis een grotere kamer. De ligging ligt dicht bij een metro.,Het enige wat tegen viel was dat je in bad moet stappen om te douchen.
8,"Struttura accogliente, stanza pulita e buona colazione",Non c’è la possibilità di lasciare i bagagli prima del check in o dopo il check out. Un hotel quattro stelle dovrebbe avere un deposito bagagli.
8,Perfekte Lage für eine London Reise.,Man konnte das Gepäck nicht zur Aufbewahrung abgeben. Bei einem späteren Abflug ist das ungünstig.
7,locatie,te kleine bed voor 2 persoon
8,Posizione comodissima vicino alla metro,Non dispongono di servizio deposito bagagli

La chambre est d’une taille satisfaisante pour la ville et très bien équipée. La wifi fonctionne parfaitement.","L’hôtel commence un peu à vieillir et aurait besoin d’un rafraîchissement (joint de douches, peinture…)

7,Betten sind sehr bequem,"Es gibt keinen Koffer Service. Also kein Raum wo der Koffer zwischenzeitlich abgestellt werden kann. Somit mussten wir unsere Koffer am Abreisetag mitnehmen, was sehr unangenehm war. Deshalb würde ich dieses Hotel nicht mehr buchen. Sehr schade, da das Zimmer und die Betten gepasst haben."
7,"Nette entree, goede ontbijtruimte. Kamer indelingen prima.","Smal bed, hard matras, dunne kussens. Vloerbedekking is oud."
7,Ottima posizione! A soli due minuti a piedi dalla metropolitana e collocato in una zona molto tranquilla,"Da migliorare la pulizia della camera, risistemare l'arredamento (polvere nelle lampade, nelle parti più nascoste c'era dello sporco, porta del bagno che ostruisce il passaggio dentro al bagno). 
All'arrivo non avevano la possibilità di tenere il nostro bagaglio (siamo arrivati alle 13:30 ed il check in era alle 15:00) e ci hanno suggerito di portarlo ad uno luggage store a pagamento nelle vicinanze.
Da aggiungere qualche scelta di dolci e salato per la colazione introducendo opzioni tipiche del posto (c'erano solo alcune cose basilari come Bacon, Salsiccia, tre piccole scelte di dolce) e magari implementare la scelta di bevande calde. 
Nel complesso buono, ma da migliorare."
7,Nur die Lage!,"Wir waren eine Gruppe von 12 Personen. Beim Check-in konnten wir in einem schon fertig gereinigten Zimmer unsere 12 Koffer abstellen bis 14 Uhr.

Beim Check-out gab es eine Diskussion mit der Dame Maria an der Rezeption.
Sie meinte es gibt keinen Raum wo wir unsere 12 Koffer hineinstellen können.
Sie hat uns auf die Kofferboxen in der U-Bahn Station Earls Court verwiesen.

Die Diskussion ging dann mit dem Hotelmanager weiter, irgendwann durften alle Koffer in unser benutztes Zimmer gestellt werden.
Warum nicht gleich so?

Ich hatte das Hotel für August wieder gebucht wegen der Lage aber nach der Diskussion werden wir dort nicht mehr übernachten!"
8,"De locatie nabij metrostation Earls Court is fantastisch! Goede bedden, mooie geluidsdichte kamers.",Bij aankomst en vertrek werd ons verteld dat onze bagage niet mocht blijven staan. Van ons werd verwacht dat we ons Londen-tripje slepend met onze koffers zouden doen. Dit hebben we niet geaccepteerd. Aangegeven dat het onacceptabel is dat men niet voor een paar uur een koffer kan achterlaten totdat de vlucht gaat.
7,"die Lage ist topp, Metro Station nur ein paar Meter entfernt, schönes Viertel mit vielen Restaurants und Bars ..","das Zimmer hätte besser geschnitten und das Bett größer sein können für ein Doppelzimmer , sollte man drauf achten,
aber dafür sehr ruhig"
7,"アールズコートの駅から近かったです。
夜が人通りが少なく暗いですが、危険性はあまり無い感じでした。
部屋にあった電子レンジには助けられました。
ロビーにはコーヒーサービスがありました。

7,LA UBICACION,LA HABITACION EN EL SUBSUELO
8,"Das London Grand Park Hotel wies mir zunächst ein Zimmer im Basement zu. Leider war dieses nur durch einen schmalen Flur zu erreichen und hatte kaum Tageslicht. Nach kurzen Gesprächen mit der Rezeption bekam ich ein anderes Zimmer ohne Aufpreis, was ausschließlich mit dem Fahrstuhl zu erreichen war. 

Die Freundlichkeit des Personals ist besonders hervorzuheben.

Das Frühstück war reichhaltig und ließ keine Wünsche offen.

Die Lage ist fantastisch und man erreicht vieles zu Fuß oder mit der nahe gelegenen U Bahn Station Earls Court. Kensington lädt zum verweilen ein und bietet viele kleine Cafés und Restaurants.","Leider war die Minibar nicht aufgefüllt und es gab auch keinen Hinweis, wie man diese auffüllen konnte. Bei 4 Sternen gehe ich eigentlich von einer gefüllten Minibar aus.

Das Bad ist sehr sauber gewesen, allerdings sehr klein, doch man kam zurecht. Shampoo etc. wurden nachgefüllt. 

Trotz Sauberkeit und unheimlicher Freundlichkeit des Personals, bedarf das Hotel einer Generalüberholung. Vieles ist schon etwas abgewohnt - was für Londoner Verhältnisse jedoch nicht ungewöhnlich ist. Trotzdem würde ich das Hotel ausnahmslos weiterempfehlen."

- Sehr hilfsbereites und immer ausreichend vorhandenes Personal an Rezeption und Frühstück
- großzügiger, heller Frühstücksraum mit Kaffee am Platz und guter Auswahl am Buffet. Man kann sich auch Eierspeisen individuell zubereiten lassen.
- obwohl das Hotel sehr zentral liegt, ist es angenehm ruhig
- Air Condition lässt sich gut regeln","- Das Bett ist ziemlich klein und die Matratze sehr weich. Das ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber kein Drama."

Posizione molto comoda per chi viaggia sull'aeroporto di Heathrow, con la metropolitana diretta a pochi passi.","Da incrementare la scelta di colazione dolce: buona l'offerta di piatti salati, anche espressi dalla cucina, ma i prodotti dolci si limitavano a qualche croissant."
8,"Hotelli vastasi Suomen S-ryhmän tasoa ja oli siis siisti ja hyvätasoinen. Henkilökunta oli auttavaista ja
ystävällistä. Sijainti oli erinomainen nähtävyyksiä ja metroyhteyksiä ajatellen. Huoneessa oli normaalin varustuksen lisäksi mikroaaltouuni +.","Kaikki oli hyvin, vessaharjaa ei ollut. Tosin emme sitä olisi tarvinneetkaan."

Restaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe, dennoch in einer ruhigen Straße inmitten schöner Gebäude gelegen. Das Hotel hat alles, was es für einen schönen Aufenthalt in London braucht, einschließlich Restaurant und Bar. Wir waren bereits mehrfach in Hotels in dieser Gegend untergebracht, erstmals in diesem Hotel - wir würden es wieder wählen, zumal die Preisexplosion hier nicht ganz so extrem war wie in den früher gebuchten Hotels.","Bei Ankunft haben wir noch die eine oder andere Hinterlasssenschaft der vorherigen Gäste im Zimmer gefunden; während unseres Aufenthalts war der Zimmerservice jedoch gut. Aus unerfindlichen Gründen kam es zu der Situation, dass wir für zwei Personen gebucht hatten, aber nur eine Person für das inkludierte Frühstück angemeldet war. Trotz mehrerer Klärungsversuche mit der Rezeption und Einschalten von booking.com ließ sich das Problem während unserer 5 Nächte nicht lösen, so dass es jeden Morgen Diskussionen mit dem Personal gab. Wir konnten am Ende zwar zu zweit und ohne Mehrpreis frühstücken, aber irgendwie kam man sich vor, als wolle man sich eine unbezahlte Leistung erschleichen."

Não mudaram rolos de papel higiénico vazios, não deitaram fora embalagens vazias de gel de banho e deixaram um balde de gelo cheio de água no quarto.
O pequeno-almoço tinha poucas opções e obrigava a pagar à parte coisas como um capuccino."

7,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,No recomiendo reservar la habitacion en el sistema -no reembolsable - Este es un hotel que tiene la particularidad de cambiar permanentemente los precios. Yo pague un precio por la habitacion y al llegar al hotel me di cuenta que si hubiera reservado ese dia tendria una mejor habitacion y desayuno incluido. Hice el reclamos y me dijeron que me mejoraban la habitacion ( ??) pero no me compensaron como si hubiera tomado la habitacion ese dia .

9,"Personal fantástico. Ubicación muy cerca del metro. Tranquilidad! Limpieza! Equipamiento habitaciones! Desayuno.Cenar allí no es extremadamente caro para Londres, y la comida no es mala.","Por poner peros, aunque hay una parada de metro al lado, andando desde el centro se tarda al menos 40 minutos. Nos dieron una habitación en planta sótano pero hay que decir que al menos la nuestra tenía ventana que daba a un patio interior."
8,"Tolle Lage in Kensington nahe einer U-Bahn-Station! Personal höflich und zuvorkommend, aber nicht aufdringlich. Insgesamt eine klasse Unterkunft mit einem sehr guten Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis!","Die Größe des Bades ist schon sehr begrenzt, was aber an den baulichen Gegebenheiten liegen dürfte. Daher ist dem Hotel eher kein Vorwurf diesbezüglich zu machen."
8,Sin ruido en la habitación,Que la habitación estuviera en los bajos.
9,"La situación del hotel, fantástica y en una calle muy tranquila. La cama era comodísima y el personal muy atento.","Nos tocó una habitación en la planta baja (00) y era un laberinto llegar hasta ella, cuando podíamos atravesar el restaurante y llegar en 30 segundos, pero no estaba permitido."
8,"Das Zimmer war sehr schön ausgestattet, das Bett sehr bequem und gemütlich. Es gab kostenloses Wasser, Tee und als Begrüßungsgeschenk Wein und Pralinen 
Frühstück war sehr gut","Unser Zimmer (obwohl als Deluxe angegeben) war im Keller mit Ausblick auf eine Mauer (es sah aus wie ein winziger Innenhof im Souterrain). Wenn man das farbig gestaltet hätte und mit ein paar Pflanzen, wäre es schöner gewesen, leider war es nur eine schmutzige Mauer.. Also haben wir die Gardinen die ganze Zeit geschlossen."
7,"Lage war gut, ruhig und nah an der U-Bahn Station.
Personal ist freundlich und hifsbereit.","Das Frühstück ist nicht empfehlenswert, man ist besser in einem Cafe nebenan aufgehoben, 
Das Fenster hat unten zwei Schlitze, welche durch eine Blende geschlossen werden sollen, die Blende fehlte, nachdem es reklamiert wurde, wurden die Schlitze mit einem Klebenband geschlossen.

7,"La ubicación, la cama y la ducha",La habitación estaba en un sótano sin ventana alguna.
8,"A localização é perfeita, próxima à uma grande estação de Metrô (subway) , que conecta com várias outras. A dica pra quem chegar pelo aeroporto de Heathrow, é ir de Metrô e saltar na Earl's Court Underground Station. São apenas 3 minutos de caminhada até o hotel, que é cercado por várias opções de comida. Ao fazer a reserva, pedimos quarto com janela e fomos atendidos. Ótimo custo benefício.","O único ponto mais fraco pra mim é o colchão, extremamente mole - mas isso é uma questão de gosto: para mim, não é recomendável."
8,"Personal an der Rezeption sehr sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Wünsche wurden sofort, zuvorkommend und zuverlässig erledigt. Zimmer etwas klein aber gut ausgestattet. Sehr gute Lage in U-Bahn Nähe und trotzdem sehr ruhig.","Frühstück ist in der Auswahl etwas beschränkt. Toilette war bei der Übernahme des Zimmers noch etwas verschmutzt, dies wurde aber sofort und rasch erledigt."
7,Vriendelijk personeel. Comfortabele bedden. Netjes,Ontbijt. Mn echtgenoot mag geen varkensvlees en er waren geen alternatieven. Waren er 4 dagen n elke dag ei voor hem. Kamer id kelder waar absoluut geen mobiel bereik was. Volgende dag andere kamer gevraagd want moest werken en had netwerk nodig. Die was op de 3de en was prima
7,"Das Frühstücksbuffet war in Ordnung und die meisten Produkte wurden frisch zubereitet.
Bei der Lobby war stets ein frischer Fruchtteller sowie Tee und Kaffee bereit und verfügbar.","Die EU Steckdose war leider defekt. Jedoch wurde unkompliziert ein EU Zwischenstecker zur Verfügung gestellt durch das Hotel. Die Einrichtung ist auch schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen (Teppiche, Dousche etc.)"
8,"Alles in allem OK, das Zimmer war relativ klein, aber es hatten eine gute Nähe zur U-Bahnstation. Frühstück war gut und recht überschaubar.",Zimmer zu klein
7,Sehr freundliches Personal.,Der Blick auf eine Kellerbetonwand bei dem bezahlten Preis pro Nacht 👎
8,"Localização excelente! A 5 minutos a pé, da estação de Earls Court, que tem ligação rápida de metro para a estação de South Kensington - muito central com bons locais para comer e museus para visitar.",Os cortinados não tapam a luz completamente. O ar condicionado é ruidoso.

7,Beliggenheden var rigtig god - det var nemt at komme fra Heathrow og til hotellet. Værelset var rent og det var et godt badeværelse. Ingen støj.,Vi boede under jorden.
9,"Zuerst hatte ich ein sehr kleines und schlechtes Zimmer,der Ausblick war mies,auf einen Schornstein mit vielen Tauben,beim Öffnen des Fensters bestand die Gefahr,dass sie rein fliegen würden.Ich habe das bemängelt und bekam nach einer Nacht dann ein gutes Zimmer.Trotzdem, das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt nicht bei diesem sehr teuren Hotel,aber London ist teuer,das weiss ich.
Insgesamt war es aber eine sehr beeindruckende Reise,in diese grandiose Metropole muss man mehrmals reisen.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
7,Ottima posizione e ben servita dai mezzi pubblici.,Il letto nella mia camera era piccolo (1 piazza e mezza )
7,Die Lage war gut. Der U-Bahnhof Earls Court ist nicht weit vom Hotel entfernt. Das Hotel liegt in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße.,"Die Ausstattung der Zimmer ist nicht mehr ganz modern. Einrichtung sehr dunkel.
Der Kaffe war sehr dünn. Einen Cappucino hätte ich extra bezahlen müssen. Kaffee und extra Milch konnte man bestellen und war im Frühstück inbegriffen.
Mein Zimmer war in Ordnung. Meine Tochter hatte allerdings ein Zimmer im Erdgeschoss mit einem Oberfenster, dass verdeckt war und nicht geöffnet werden konnte. Tageslicht hatte sie also nicht."
7,"Dat wij een upgrade kregen naar de 4e verdieping en deze keer niet in de kelder belanden, dat was fijn.","Wij zijn hier al een aantal malen geweest, voor het laatst in 2019 en wij vonden het ontbijt een stuk minder dan eerst, en het personeel ook wat minder. Achter de receptie waren ze nog steeds heel vriendelijk, maar er waren 2 portiers, en de ene vonden wij ongeïnteresseerd, vrij chagrijnig, was er elke keer niet om de koffers te dragen etc. of stond beneden in de kelder bij de damestoiletten te bellen. Misschien kwam het doordat hij er nog niet zo lang werkte. Ook bij het ontbijt was er één iemand die echt heel ongezellig keek, elke dag weer.
In ieder geval, vergeleken bij de vorige keren vonden wij het nu wat tegenvallen. Het was vergeleken met de vorige keer allemaal erg onpersoonlijk."

Für einen kurzen Städtetrip nach London super geeignet. In unmittelbarer Umgebung befinden sich einige Pubs und Restaurants, sodass man den Stadtteil abends eigentlich gar nicht verlassen braucht. :)","Das Doppelbett war für unseren Geschmack sehr schmal und es gab nur eine Decke für zwei Personen. Leider ließ sich die Lüftung nicht komplett ausschalten und lief die ganze Nacht gut hörbar durch.
Preislich war das Hotel für uns gerade noch so akzeptabel, für London wohl anscheinend aber ublicher Preis."

Käse und Schinken rollten sich an den Rändern hoch, waren völlig vertrocknet. Die Brötchen waren tot gebacken, hätten sich aber noch gut als Paniermehl verarbeiten lassen. Das krümelige Rührei ließ vermuten, dass der Ursprung nichts mit Hühnereiern zu tun hatte. Für ein 4 Sterne Hotel sind die Erwartungen hier überhaupt nicht erfüllt worden. Der Kaffee war in Ordnung."

Si es cierto que despues de reclamar nos cambiaron la cama y pusieron una cama en condiciones.
8,"Die Nähe zur gut angebundenen U-Bahn Station Earl's Court.
Das Hotel liegt in einer eher ruhigeren Nebenstraße.",Die Bar schließt immer um 21 Uhr. Der Kaffee zum überschaubaren Frühstück ist eine Katastrophe.
8,sehr gute Anbindung vom Flughafen bis zur U-Bahn Station Earls Court sowie der kurze Weg von der U-Bahn Station bis zum Hotel. Hotel war ruhig und das Personal sehr freundlich.,"Die Ausstattung der Zimmer könnte mal erneuert werden. Das Frühstück war gut , jedoch hätte ich mir mehr Abwechslung gewünscht , vor allem an Gemüse hat es mir gefehlt."

Personal muy amable y disponible. Posibilidad de late check-out.","Habitaciones un tanto pequeñas sin ser minúsculas, ningún servicio adicional en el Hotel (salones, business center, p.e.), sin apenas espacio de trabajo en la habitación (por lo demás correctamente amueblada, aunque ligeramente envejecida). Típico hotel urbano para turistas bien comunicado (como todo el entorno de Hogarth Road), sin mayores pretensiones. No especialmente para viajes de trabajo."
8,"Comfortabele kamer en badkamer. Airco is goed. Rustige, veilige straat, metro halte is heel dichtbij: ideaal.","Ontbijt is goed maar had wat uitgebreider gekund (meer koude en gezonde keuzes). Bed was goed, voor mij te zacht matras maar dat is persoonlijk."
8,Gute Lage. Zu Fuß schnell bei der U-Bahn Earl's court. Restaurants und Cafe in der Nähe. Sehr ruhig. Gutes WLAN.,Frühstück teuer und nicht besonders. Bett schmal und Zimmer recht klein.
8,"Lo mejor es la ubicación a unos 200m del underground, linea directa Picadilly y District (conexión con Picadilly, Covent o Westminster en unos 20 minutos). Muchas cafeterías cerca, y el barrio es de clase alta -cerca de Kensington y Chelsea-. El museo de Historia Natural está a unos 12 minutos andando.
La habitación era espaciosa, silenciosa porque la calle era tranquila y tenía microondas, kettle y enchufes europeos.","No reponian los artículos de aseo, o si lo hacían siempre daban champús. Las cortinas apenas tapaban la luz. Demasiada moqueta en el exterior y el interior, un único ascensor y demasiadas puertas en los distintos pisos que imposibilitan una rápida evacuación. El servicio de habitaciones venía muy pronto a hacer las mismas (antes de las 10am), de forma que te colaban una tarjeta por debajo de la puerta en la que te decían que debías llamar a recepción si querías que te hicieran la cama. La cama era algo dura, y las almohadas muy planas dificultando dormir correctamente"

Der Frühstücksraum ist sehr sauber, das Frühstück war lecker.","Das Frühstücksbuffett könnte etwas großzügiger und abwechslungsreicher sein.

Al nostro arrivo ci è stato proposto un upgrade che ci ha permesso di scegliere una stanza più grande.
La camera era comoda, silenziosa, calda e ben attrezzata in quanto erano presenti un bollitore, un forno a microonde, un asse e il ferro da stiro (che però noi non abbiamo utilizzato).","L’esperienza è stata molto positiva nel complesso, ma alcune cose non ci hanno soddisfatto del tutto.
Anche se le stanze che ci sono state proposte erano ampie erano collocate tutte al piano seminterrato, per cui pur avendo la finestra non potevamo aprirla né tenere le tende aperte perché la camera affacciava sul marciapiede. Per questo motivo la stanza risultava piuttosto buia, anche perché vi era una scarsa illuminazione elettrica.
Le stanze e la struttura in generale avrebbero bisogno di una rinfrescata e di un intervento di ammodernamento.
Non molto comoda la presenza della vasca perché piuttosto alta e scivolosa, avremmo preferito una semplice doccia."

We kwamen aan op een dinsdag en blijkbaar is dat de dag dat alle buurtbewoners hun afval op straat zetten. Het hotel staat in een superdeluxe wijk dus we vonden al dat afval heel raar. Gelukkig was aan het eind van de dag alles opgeruimd. Blijkbaar werken ze daar niet met containers :)
Als je komt als toerist, bereid je dan voor op het openbaar vervoer. Wij hadden dat niet voldoende uitgedacht en hebben uiteindelijk veel van de taxi gebruik gemaakt. Heel luxe en niet al te duur, maar bus en metro zijn natuurlijk veel goedkoper. De hop-on-hop-off bus beviel ons erg slecht omdat die niet op vaste tijden rijden en hooguit 1 x per uur langskomen.

Le personnel était correct mais pas non plus formidable (on aurait aimé un peu plus de sourire et de prévenance, mais ils faisaient le job pour satisfaire à nos demandes).
Le petit déjeuner était bon mais pas fantastique non plus.","Il nous a semblé que l'hôtel, peut être dû aux 2 années de Covid précédant notre arrivée, aurait pu bénéficier d'avantage d'entretien pour garder son statut 4 étoiles sans discussion. En effet, certaines usures étaient flagrantes sans les salles de bain et certaines literies un peu fatiguées."

Zeer goede locatie: dicht bij metro en high street. Aangename buurt met wat pubs en restaurants, maar straat zelf zeer rustig. Ideaal om goed te slapen.
De kamer was proper, alle faciliteiten aanwezig en zeeer comfortabele bedden.
Het ontbijt vond ik voldoende voor 10 pond (dag voordien gereserveerd aan de receptie): je kan een english breakfast opscheppen, maar ook keuze in wat koffiekoeken, cereals, fruit..","De algemene staat van het hotel begint achteruit te gaan. Er is dringend investering nodig om de details weer in orde te brengen. Reeds nipt voor een 4ster hotel momenteel (zitbank los in ontbijtzaal, afbladerende verf, zetel in de kamer begint stuk te gaan,...). Het hotel is proper maar heeft opnieuw extra verzorging nodig.
Housekeeping: indien je dit wil, moet je lampje laten branden. Ik vind dat niet de standaard aanpak in een 4ster hotel; dit kan best vermeld worden bij check-in."
7,"Personalet var enormt imødekommende og hjælpsomt. Vi havde badekar - fantastisk! Og dejligt at bo højt oppe på 5. sal. Morgenmaden var tilpas og helt fin, med meget gode pølser, og restauranten har en god afternoon tea, i både engelsk og indisk variant. Beliggenheden var i top, ganske nær Earl's Court Tube Station og mange restauranter, pubber og butikker, og med buslinjer mod centrum rundt om hjørnet - og ikke så langt fra Hyde Park. Vi kommer helt sikkert gerne igen.","Vores hotelværelse var ret koldt, vinduet kunne ikke lukke helt i, så den, der lå nærmest vinduet, frøs hele natten. Og det var lidt svært at regulere air conditionen. Desuden var sengen lidt for smal for to velvoksne skandinaver. Og det ville være dejligt, hvis man på forhånd fik hver sin dyne i stedet for en deledyne. Tv-signalet var dårligt og flimrende på de fleste af kanalerne, og wifien fungerede heller ikke så godt. Vi undrede os i øvrigt lidt over, at hotellet har 4 stjerner, for sine steder var det noget nedslidt. Havde det ligget i Skandinavien, ville det formentlig højst få 3 stjerner."

Die Lage vom Hotel ist top!","Wir hatten ein Deluxe Zimmer gebucht, bekamen ein Zimmer im Kelletraktr, mit Fenster, hinter dem Vorhang gab es eine Beleuchtung, der Ausblick war nur eine weisse Wand. Aber da wir nur 3 Nächte dort waren und viel unterwegs, haben wir das weggesteckt. Bei einem Deluxe Zimmer hätten wir schon ein Zimmer mit Aussicht erwartet, wenn auch nur auf die Strasse."

Bequeme Möbel und angenehm große Zimmer. Wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt und konnten unseren Aufenthalt genießen.

Wir hatten leider das Problem, dass in unserem gebuchten Zimmer die Klimaanlage ausgefallen war. Uns wurde direkt ein neues Zimmer angeboten, was wir jedoch unsererseits vorerst verneint haben und nur um einen Ventilator gebeten haben, den wir auch erhielten. Nach der zweiten Nacht wurden wir inständig vom Personal gebeten, dass Zimmer zu wechseln, da dieses es für nicht zumutbar hielten. Haben dann ohne weitere Kosten ein neuen und größeres Zimmer erhalten.","Was wir zu bemängeln haben ist die Sauberkeit an der ein oder anderen Stelle.

7,La colazione non è molto varia. Anche un semplice espresso è a pagamento. La qualità è il servizio non giustificano un prezzo così alto,Le foto non corrispondono alla realtà. Ho prenotato una camera matrimoniale superiore e mi sono ritrovata con un letto alla francese piccolissimo. Nella descrizione era specificato ma vedendo le foto si aveva un'altra impressione. Le camere sono davvero piccole. Ottima posizione. Personale cortese.
7,beliggenheden var fornuftig i forhold til centrum og undergrunden - venligt personale.,"fik værelse uden vindue, det fungere ikke og virker indelukket - gør at man ikke benytter værelses mere end højst nødvendigt - morgenmaden var ikke speciel spændende og udvalget begrænset."

7,"Top Lage, sehr ruhig gelegen. Es wurde täglich komplementäres Wasser und Kaffee/Tee auf dem Zimmer aufgefüllt.
Internationale Steckeranschlüsse.","Zimmer sind sehr hellhörig.
Das Badezimmer war nicht komplett sauber.
Das Frühstück ist sehr einfach gehalten und entspricht nicht dem Standard eines 4-Sterne Hotels. Die Auswahl war extrem schlecht, es wird regulärer Kaffee oder Tee angeboten, für besondere Getränke (Cappuccino etc.) muss man extra zahlen."
7,Posizione favorevolissima a due passi dalla metro di Earl's Court che va diretta in centro. Posti per mangiare ad un passo dall'hotel. Personale gentile.,"Si affonda nel materasso anche solo sedendosi sul letto . Interruttori per spegnere le luci non facilmente identificabili: ho chiesto per tre giorni di spegnermi una luce di cortesia sopra lo scaffale dell'angolo con teiera ecc senza successo. Alla fine l'ho scoperto da me (un pulsante improponibile: per info, e' quello tondo, tipo volume radio, vicino ad un lato solo del letto, sopra il comodino) dopo aver dormito per 4 giorni con la luce accesa.... Nel cambio asciugamani per due giorni ne mancava sempre qualcuno. Quando ho chiesto alla reception mi hanno portato quelli sbagliati dicendo che gli altri non erano piu' disponibili (!!)."

Dies war problemlos möglich, wenn auch erst am nächsten Tag, da das Hotel ausgebucht war. Unser Gepäck wurde für uns umgezogen und sich danach auch erkundigt, ob das neue Zimmer besser ist und wir noch etwas brauchen. Das neue Zimmer war perfekt und wir hatten einen super Aufenthalt. Die Lage ist top, vor allem wenn man wie wir morgens gern laufen geht - Kensington, Hyde Park und auch Battersea Park boten uns tolle Momente beim Morgenlauf. Man ist aber auch super an die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel angeschlossen. Die Gegend ist außerdem sehr sicher und vergleichsweise ruhig.

Huoneessa oli siistiä ja itse säädettävä, toimiva (!) ilmastointi, kampauspöytä ja tuoli, nojatuoli, matkalaukkuteline ja pieni vaatekaappi, jossa hengareita. Vuode oli mukava, olisiko ollut hitusen kapeampi kuin perinteinen parivuode. Pistorasiassa oli valmiina erilaisia vaihtoehtoja töpseleille, joten adapteria ei tarvittu. Kylpyhuoneessa amme, jonka päällä tavallinen suihku + rainshower, hyvä vedenpaine, kylpypyyhkeet, käsipyyhkeet, lattiapyyhe, hiustenkuivaaja, shampoo, hoitoaine, suihkusaippua ja suihkumyssyt.

3,"O hotel é próximo do metrô e a localização como um todo é muito boa, com todo tipo de restaurante perto e bastante segura.

O hotel é muito limpo e todo novinho, além disso os funcionários são bastante prestativos e educados.","Chegamos no hotel 1 hora da manhã, nos colocaram em um quarto que não tinham energia, somente as luzes funcionavam. Tomadas, frigobar, secador e microondas não funcionavam, não tínhamos nem como carregar o celular.

Nos trocaram de quarto e incrivelmente o quarto novo também não tinha energia, ninguém checou antes de nos trocar de quarto.

Reclamamos e tentaram nos convencer a esperar até 8 horas da manhã para nos colocarem em um novo quarto pois não tinham disponível, depois de desistirmos, exaustos e com fome, mudaram de ideia e nos trocaram de quarto novamente. O novo quarto era frio, tinha uma janela que entrava ar frio e não tinha jeito de resolver, mesmo com o aquecedor no máximo o quarto ainda continuava frio, a cama também parecia ser menor que uma cama de casal, até a coberta era pequena. 

Eu e minha esposa acabamos desistindo de reclamar, já era 4 horas da manhã quando fomos colocados em um novo quarto e se não fosse a ajuda de um os funcionário do hotel teríamos ficado com fome, acho que ele ficou com pena da nossa situação e nos ajudou a pedir uma pizza.

Em resumo, acabamos perdendo toda a manhã do dia pois só conseguimos dormir quando já era mais de 5 horas da manhã. Nossa viagem era curta e perdemos nosso planejamento do primeiro dia.

Também não gostei do café da manhã, mas isso foi uma peculiaridade minha. Era uma café da manhã com poucas opções e destinado principalmente a Britânicos, típico (feijão adocicado com ovo, bacon e linguiça). Acredito que poderiam considerar que muitos turistas não comeriam o que estava sendo oferecido. A partir do segundo dia decidimos comprar nosso próprio café, embora já havíamos pago pelo café nos 3 dias.

Acredito que nossa experiência tenha sido totalmente frustada pelo problema quando chegamos e espero que tenhamos sido excessão."

Sia all’arrivo che alla partenza la reception non ci ha tenuto i bagagli, dicendo che fosse una decisione del manager dell’hotel che è stata presa pochi giorni prima del nostro arrivo (8-10 dicembre).
Per chi come noi arriva la mattina presto (noi alle 9:00) e riparte verso l’aeroporto in serata (17:00) è un mancato servizio che può anche rovinare una vacanza, soprattutto in una città enorme come Londra.
Per nostra fortuna un hotel della stessa strada ci ha tenuto le valigie (gratis!) e ce la siamo cavata ma non ci si comporta assolutamente così. Il tutto accompagnato da risatine dello staff alla reception."
4,Nähe zur Ubahn ist extrem angenehm,"Es gibt keine Möglichkeit die Koffer dort zu lassen. Habe ich bis jetzt noch in keinem Hotel erlebt und macht es natürlich sehr mühsam wenn man etwas früher als Check-In ankommt. Für den Preis erwarte ich mir diesen Service.

Keine Nüsse, Samen etc. zum Müsli."
5,Hotellets läge ligger bra placerat det är nära tunnelbanan med bra promenadavstånd in mot stan.,"Mycket starka dofter i korridorer (parfymerade luftrenare) ej bra för astmatiker.
Bra att se över taxibolaget som hotellet använder för de känns inte förtroendeingivande då de ej håller utlovade priser (fixed rate) ville lura oss."

6,Hyvä sijainti lähellä Earl's Courtin asemaa ja siistit huoneet. Hiljainen sivukatu.,"Olimme varanneet kaksi Superior-huonetta hotellista. Meille yritettiin tarjota homeelta tuoksahtavaa huonetta kellarikerroksesta ilman kunnon ikkunaa ja näkymä parin neliömetrin 'sisäpihalle', joka siis oli tyhjä likainen 'sementtikaivo'. Seuraavaksi saimme huoneet toisesta kerroksesta sisäpihan puolelta, ikkunasta näkymä kahden metrin päässä olevaan tiiliseinään. Lopulta saimme huoneet viidennestä kerroksesta, pienillä ikkunoilla, mutta sentään taivas näkyi ja huoneeseen tuli luonnonvaloa. Toisen huoneen sängyssä oli vanha viettävä jousipatja ja kovat littanat tyynyt. Kannattaa varausvaiheessa pyytää huone vähintään kolmannesta kerroksesta ja kunnon ikkunoilla. Wifi toimi heikosti, jos ollenkaan."
4,Fin beliggenhet!,"Vi fikk rom i underetasjen, med et vindu ut i en bakgård, rett ved et fuglereir. Fuglene holdt oss våkne fra tidlig morgen. Det luktet også mugg i kjelleren. Frokosten var heller ikke veldig imponerende, det var tomt på nesten alle fat da vi kom til frokost."

Deze kreeg slippers, wijn, nootjes, frisdrank. Waarom? De prijzen zijn al niet goedkoop dus vind ik wel dat dit voor een superiorkamer ook zo zou moeten zijn."

2,Het enige positieve aan dit hotel is de centrale ligging.,We hadden een superior room met uitzicht op de stad geboekt. Dat bleek bij aankomst een kamer in de kelder zonder raam. Na veel gedoe kregen we een heel kleine kamer met uitzicht op een blinde muur en een twijfelaar die dienst deed als bed. Geen enkele compensatie was bespreekbaar.

4,"Gute Lage direkt am Earl’s Court, wie man es auf der Karte sehen kann. Ruhige Seitenstraße. Klimaanlage funktioniert.","Das Zimmer war schmutzig, seine Einrichtung abgenutzt. Auf Teppich, Vorhängen und den Möbeln waren Flecken und Streifen. Viel Staub auf den Möbeln und tote Insekten auf der Fensterbank. Es roch recht stark nach einem Raumduftspray. Das legt die Vermutung nahe, dass etwas überdeckt werden soll. Die Matratze des winzigen Betts war zu weich. 

Überhaupt eine sehr uninspirierte und in die Jahre gekommene Einrichtung. Das Hotel ist weit weg von vier Sternen. Nach Deutschen Maßstäben verdient es nicht einen einzigen."
3,خيارات الافطار كانت محدودة ولا ترقى بأن تستحق أن أدفع لها مقابل.,حالة الفندق لم تكن جيدة.. يبدو أن الفندق تحت التحديث.. كان هناك صيانة في الفندق فترة تواجدي به.. المصعد واحد فقط وقديم وبطئ جداً.

Aspiratore in bagno non funzionante, porta del bagno che non chiude bene, ridipintura eseguita in modo grossolano (piano lavandino e rubinetteria se pur nuovi macchiati) un vero peccato!.

4,Morgenmad var ok. Personalet var flinke og hjælpsomme.,"Personalet sprayede hele hotellet med frisk-dufter hele tiden (det er sundhedsskadeligt), så der var en kunstig lugt hele tiden. 
Den ene sengelampe virkede ikke. 
Køleskabet virkede ikke.
Der var en stor, grim plamage af fugt i det ene hjørne ved vinduet på værelset.
Badeværelsesgulvet var iskoldt! Et par badetøfler kunne have hjulpet..."
6,Sijainti on loistava. Club tason huone Lontoon mittapuulla ihan tilava. Aamiaisella parasta oli tuoreet pilkotut hedelmät ja maukkaat minicroissantit.,"Huone nuhjuinen ja tunkkainen. Palvelu paikoin tökki. Esimerkiksi huoneessa piti olla kylpytakit, mutta ei ollut. Niitä jouduttiin neljä kertaa pyytämään ennen kuin saatiin. Aamiainen keskinkertainen."
6,"Nettes Personal, Gute Lage, Preis-Leistung in Ordnung
Typisch englisches Frühstück, etwas wenig Auswahl beim Gebäck","Zimmer waren an sich sauber, Der Vorhang war mit weißen Flecken versehen"

3,"Alter Schuppen, in Deutschland wär das nicht mal ne Pension. Auf Keinen Fall machen.","Aufzug drei Tage kaputt! Fenster kann man nicht aufmachen, Klimanlage macht ein Höllenlärm.

6,Petit déjeuner,Retard du service de petit déjeuner parce que le chef est arrivé en retard à 7h15 au lieu de 7h pour l ouverture de la salle
4,"Het personeel was bereid te helpen bij vragen, maar dit waren vragen die eigenlijk niet gesteld hadden moeten worden. Zo kon ik in het begin zelf niet de verwarming regelen maar moest dit aangezet worden nadat ik ging vragen waarom het zo koud bleef in de kamer. 

De locatie was ook ruim voldoende, makkelijk te bereiken vanaf metrostation Earls Court, genoeg faciliteiten in de buurt (restaurants, supermarkten, etc.).",De hygiëne was zeer onder de maat. Er was heel veel stof in de kamer. Daarnaast zat er (schimmel)aanslag in de douche en omgeving. Zelfs nadat de schoonmaak langs was geweest was het niet schoner dan de avond ervoor (een dag was het zelfs nog viezer).
3,"Foram atenciosos : deixaram frutas , água, até um vinho. Isso após ter solicitado mudança de quarto, pois o primeiro ficava no sótão.","Carpete , carpete e carpete ! Velho e deve ter ácaro ou algum bicho pois são de lá com várias picadas. O chuveiro , contrariando diversas opiniões de hóspedes , o nosso tinha pressão muito fraca. Gostaria de registrar a minha decepção com a estadia, pois havia reservado para 5 noites no quarto triplo, com banheira. A primeira noite, foi de fato num quarto triplo, porém, por ser no sótão e sem acesso ao elevador, solicitei mudança . Colocaram-nos num quarto duplo, bem menor, sem banheira . A
Terceira cama era quase infantil. Enfim, foi uma experiência muito desagradável, certamente não retornarei nesse hotel."
6,Temiz ve düzgün bir otel odanın konumu hariç iyi,Oda -2. Katta uzun 4 koridar 4 ayrı kapıdan geçerek ulaşılan sığınak gibi bir yerdeydi. Acil birşey olsa oradan nasıl çıkılır bilemiyorum
6,Ottima colazione e posizione perfetta vicinissima alla metro,"Ci hanno dato una camera diversa da quella prenotata. Era sottoterra nonostante quella della mia prenotazione non indicava tale possibilità. Inoltre era fredda, lo abbiamo comunicato e sembrava che già ospiti precedenti avessero esposto il problema. Dopo di ciò allora hanno fatto partire il condizionatore. Personale assolutamente scortese, a tratti nemmeno buongiorno e buonasera."
5,"Lo staff, gentile e disponibile.","La colazione! In buona sostanza una truffa. Se seleziono “colazione incluse” e decido di pagare una tariffa maggiorata, il motivo è evitare di dover stare a contrattare la mattina appena sveglio. Invece in questo albergo, con nostra grande sorpresa, la colazione pagata NON include un drink caldo, se non un caffè nero orribile e già freddo, o un tè. Francamente imbarazzante che si possa pensare di chiedere un extra per le bevande calde a colazione!!! Inoltre, non era scritto da nessuna parte su Booking e per quanto ci riguarda d’ora in po’ ci fideremo ancora meno della piattaforma online di Booking."
6,L’emplacement est parfait,"Le rapport qualité/prix n’y est pas.

Safe funktionierte nicht, ich habe das am Ankunftstag gemeldet, repariert wurde wer einen Tag vor Abreise.
Fenster war bei geschlossnem Zustand im oberen Bereich offen, sodass man den Straßenlärm hörte und es in der Nacht ziemlich kalt war und bei Regen, den wir hatten das Regenwasser eingedrungen ist.
Ich habe das an der Rezeption mehrer Male reklamiert es wurde mir gesagt, dass es in Ordnung gebracht wird, das jedoch nie geschah am Abreisetag hat man mir erklärt, dass das normal ist und kein Reklamationsgrund.
Des Weiteren war der Wasserdruck (wir waren im 5 Stock) so schwach, dass es fast unmöglich war zu duschen.
In der Badenwannendusche war Schimmel in den Fugen.
Das Handwaschbecken hatten einen Riss.
Schimmel war auch im Schlafraum nahe dem Fenster zu finden, was anscheinend daher rührt, dass sich das Fenster nicht ganz schliessen lässt.
Vorhangstange war abgerissen .


Der Preis von € 1500 für 5 Nächte ist weit überzogen und nicht gerechtfertigt.
Ich war das erste und letzte Mal in diesem Hotel.

6,"Localização próxima do metrô, supermercados e diversos restaurantes. Funcionários excelentes e prestativos.","É um hotel médio, deveria ter 3 estrelas e não 4. Café da manhã muito fraco, com poucas opções, todo dia igual. Limpeza deixa a desejar. Conforto da cama somente aceitável."

6,"Locatie was dichtbij Metro station. 
Alle plaatsen in Londen waren eenvoudig te bereiken.
Staff was vriendelijk maar onervaren en onzeker","Zeer kleine en donkere kamers met een klein bed
Ontbijt was zeer basic en met produkten van matige kwaliteit + veel extras die te betalen waren ( Chocomelk was 4.5£).
Badkamers zeer klein en basic.
Er was veel personeel was eigenlijk niet getraind en zeer onzeker.
Zeer duur voor het basis comfort en ontbijt."
4,"Die Lage hat uns sehr gut gefallen .

6,Situation,bruit dans les couloirs et propreté approximative
5,"die Lage ist o.k., durch die Nähe zu Earl's Court, der U-Bahnstation. Personal war höflich, doch einige Angestellte sind der 
englischen Sprach nicht mächtig. Auf den Anruf: Ich habe im Zimmer kein heisses Wasser für die Dusche kam tatsächlich 5 x die Rückfrage ob ich eine Wasserflache benötige? Die Bitte um Earl Grey Tee erbrachte immer wieder ein Kännchen vorsichtshalber ohne Beutel und Kennzeichnung daran, da die Bedienung den Tee nicht kannte und auch der Sprache nicht mächtig war. Das Hotel hat Earl Grey Tee!! Gute Güte, fragt Eure Kollegen. Die Duschkabine ist von Schimmel geplagt,
die Teppichböden haben jahrelang keine Shampoonierung erfahren. Es gibt für das ganze Haus mit 5 Etagen nur 1 Lift.
4 Sterne = das kann sich das Hotel nur wünschen.","Das Frühstück ist absolut schlecht, billig und ohne jede Abwechslung. Täglich verkohlte Grilltomaten, scheußliche Bohnen, in Tomatenauce, die Variante mit Unmengen von Zucker drin, Toastbrot mit Zuckeranteilen, die jeden Mediziner grausen, frittierte Kartoffelecken, absolut kein Angebot für Vegetarier/Veganer, außer Melone und div. rohes Obst, und zur Krönung: Kaffee der Instantkaffee ist - was soll das????

6,מיקום מעולה. שקט. צוות אדיב ומסביר פנים.,החדר שקיבלנו היה בקומת מרתף ליד כניסת ספקים. לא נעים ולא נוח להיסחב עם תיקים ומזוודות. אין נגישות עם מעלית לקומה הזו. חדר המדרגות מסריח ולא נעים. החדר היה נקי.
3,"De ligging was goed, kort bij de metro voor naar het centrum te gaan. Personeel was vriendelijk.","We hadden een Deluxe kamer geboekt, maar toen we begeleid werden naar onze kamer kwamen we in een kelder terecht. Door de verschillende vieze gangen heen was er een enorme stank lucht. De kamer zelf was alles behalve ‘Deluxe’.. het balkon was horror, het zat vol duiven uitwerpselen en we keken uit op de airco installaties van heel de kelder. Het tapijt in de kamer was ook vies en onhygiënisch. De badkamer zeer klein, en niet echt goed gepoetst voor ons verblijf maar ook niet tijdens. Na een nacht vol duiven geluiden op ons balkon naar de ontbijt ruimte, zeer weinig keuze dus opzoek naar een bakker dan maar. Zeker geen 4 sterren waard, en geen aanrader."

Das erste Zimmer hatte eine defekte Klimaanlage nach dem Zimmer Wechsel waren wir dann in einem Zimmer im Keller ohne Tageslicht und schlechter Luft.
- leider mussten wir 2 Tage hinter einander jeweils nach Toilettenpapier fragen da man immer nur eine Rolle bekommen hat. 
- Das Frühstücks Buffet war sehr klein und auch nicht wirklich frisch. Kurz nach 10:30 wurden wir dann aus dem Frühstücks Raum gebeten. 
- Die Sauberkeit des Hotels lässt leider zu wünschen übrig. 
- Preis Leistung stimmt hier leider absolut nicht!"

6,"l’emplacement est parfait, à côté de la gare",nous avons été soi-disant reclassées mais ça sentait très fort le tabac au RDC. très désagréable
3,"Hotellet lå fint i forhold til offentlig transport. 
Da vi ankom fik vi et værelse uden vindue - dette var ikke beskrevet i den valgte værelseskategori. Vi bad om et værelse med vindue og det dik vi så.","Morgenmaden var meget uinspirerende og der var fluer. Slidt hotel. Vinduet på værelset var ikke tæt. Når man har værelser uden vindue, bør det

Les petits déjeuners sont très moyen aucun produit de qualité, et l'ensemble du personnel aucun sourire, on a vraiment l'air de les embêter...

4,"Die Lage war sehr gut. Das Zimmer war an sich gut ausgestattet, die Dusche war schön.","Das Zimmer war im Erdgeschoss direkt neben der Rezeption, unser Ausblick ging auf einen schmutzigen Balkon und eine 2m weit entfernte Hauswand. In der kleinen schmutzigen Gasse wohnten viele Tauben, die uns morgens weckten. Das Fenster lies sich nur ein paar Zentimeter öffnen und die Leute vom Haus gegenüber konnten immer in unser Zimmer sehen, weshalb wir zu jeder Tagezeit die Vorhänge schließen und die Klimaanlage anlassen mussten.

Antipathiques, aucune ampathie. A peine un bonjour. Petit déjeuner très moyen. Ne vaut absolument pas le prix demandé,
même si leur solution au bout de 3 nuits à été de vouloir nous mettre au sous sol dans une chambre au fin fond de l'hôtel qui sentait l'humidité !!!

La tripla aveva un letto matrimoniale e un lettino basso e scomodo, poteva andar bene per un bambino di tre anni, ma la prenotazione era senza dubbio per tre adulti!

1,solo destacaría la ubicación del resto NADA.,Reservamos una habitacion para 3 adultos donde indicaba una cama doble y una individual. Cuando llegamos nos encontramos una cama doble y una cama supletoria para niños pequeños de no mas de 4/5 años. Una vergüenza!!!!. Tuvimos que dormir los 3 en la doble porque en la pequeña tras una sola noche me levante con un dolor de cuerpo horrible. El personal muy desagradable sobre todo el chico de recepción al que nos quejamos. Tuve que bajar a recepción a por gel porque no lo reponen a diario. La bañera resbala y no tienes para agarrarte al salir y si eres alto no cabes en la ducha. Nos ofrecieron como solucion irnos a un hotel de peor calidad pagando lo mismo y con un sofa cama................ NO nos había pasado nunca en ninguna ciudad.

4,"Nära tunnelbanan och restauranger , personal fanns tillgänglig vid behov.","Det var smutsig och rummen hade mycket dålig ventilation! Det luktade fukt överallt som delvis döljes av parfym lukt 🫣.. Vårt första rum hade svart mögel i badrummet, det fick vi som tur var byta till ett annat!
Madrassen hade fläckar från andra gäster😡
Frukosten var så intetsägande!"
4,"Lage gut bei Earls Court
Restaurant am Abend sehr zu empfehlen (extra zu bezahlen)","Alles war sehr staubig und teilweise dreckig.
Zimmer sehr hellhörig und dunkel.
Beim Frühstück keine große Auswahl, ansonsten Baked Beans waren gut, alles andere passabel. 

Für 2 Personen nur ein relatives schmales Doppelbett. Nur 1 Matratze und eine Decke für zwei Personen. 

Wenn Nachbarn geduscht haben, ist das Wasser teilweise beim Duschkopf rinnsalartig herausgeronnen.
Klospülung war mehrmals durch die Wand von anderen Zimmern zu hören.

Handgriff bei einem Kasten defekt."
3,"Ottima posizione vicino alla fermata Earl's court della Piccadilly, comunque in una strada tranquilla. In camera bollitore ed acqua gratis ogni giorno. Personale gentile e disponibile. Dimensione della stanza sopra la media per Londra. Colazione discreta.","La ns. stanza era sotto il livello strada e senza finestre, aveva solo un lucernario oscurato che non faceva passare la luce ma i rumori si (tipo pioggia o schiamazzi di una festa) per cui sonno non sempre tranquillo."
4,"O hotel foi gentil em oferecer um upgrade por estarmos em lua de mel. A localização do hotel é ótima, muito próxima de metrô, restaurantes e farmácia. O quarto era limpo.","Ao chegarmos houve um problema com meu cartão, o valor da compra excedeu o limite diário de compra que eu havia definido. Enquanto eu tentava resolver o problema no app do cartão, o funcionário repetia outras alternativas de pagamento, como dividir em mais cartões. Me senti constrangido e usei um outro cartão que me cobrava mais taxas, pois ali ficou parecendo que ele achou que eu não fosse pagar. E não sei como isso pode ser um problema também já que eles debitam em segurança a primeira diária do hotel, mas ok.
Chegamos no quarto, a cama é horrível e afunda muito. Era realmente difícil de achar uma posição para dormir. A vista do quarto que ficamos era bem estranha, como nos fundos de um lugar feio. Ficamos no segundo andar, ou seja me pergunto como ficaria se não tivéssemos ganhado upgrade, porque eles tem inclusive quartos no subsolo, onde o elevador sequer chega.
Nossa estadia não havia café da manhã incluso. Fizemos uma pré reserva do café pro dia seguinte, que foi imediatamente cobrada. Estranho mas ok. No dia seguinte fomos questionados em frente de todos os outros hóspedes se havíamos realmente pagado. Falamos obviamente que sim, o funcionário me pediu o comprovante de pagamento, o que é claro não carrego comigo durante o café da manhã. Tive que mostrar meu app do banco para comprovar. Situação realmente chata. Como se não bastasse, ao passar novamente pela recepção, fomos novamente questionados sobre isso, solicitando o comprovante de pagamento. Dessa vez, já esperando isso, levamos o comprovante e entregamos. Ainda assim houve uma certa checagem por parte do funcionário, que depois confirmou estar tudo ok.
Não me entendam mal, os funcionários são super simpáticos e atenciosos, mas fiquei realmente constrangido nessas duas situações envolvendo pagamento.
O café da manhã não tem muitas opções. Por exemplo pedi um capuccino e não estava incluso, iria ser cobrado a parte."

3) Er was geen zeep aanwezig, enkel shampoo

Fortunatamente sono arrivato presto e sono riusciti a spostarmi in una camera con finestra apribile, seppur non chiudibile adeguatamente e si sentivano i rumori della strada strada dalla quale arrivavano schiamazzi notturni ed anche liti (forse zona poco raccomandabile???). Unico hotel che se durante la colazione chiedi un cappuccino ti viene richiesto un supplemento. Servono solo caffè e te. Il resto paghi. Sono stato molto meglio come colazione in un Ibis che costa come struttura meno!!"
3,"Zimmer und Bad viel zu klein. Offenkundig schlechtes Management. Völlig unerklärlich, wie die 4 Sterne Bewertung zustande kam. Dreckige Zimmer, vöiiig überteuert. Zeitweise kein Strom.

les photos de l’établissement ne sont pas representative de la réalité. il ne mérite pas autant des étoiles."

One night before flight - Heathrow from Paddington is a breeze 
The staff were super friendly and wanted to know about the stay 
I would stay here again",A little tired and noise from floor above but that can be in any hotel - think B&B any seafront - no lift
8,Cosy hotel with nice staff. Very good location near Paddington trainstation. Clean rooms with own bathroom.,"Very small toilets, no breakfast. It’s a bit outdated."
6,The location is great,"Only one plug sockets for two ladies getting ready, kettle had to be boiled underneath a dressing table on the floor . Had to unplug the telly to charge a phone !"

7,Close to Paddington. Great staff. Very comfortable bad.,Room was tiny but price was good.
8,Location and really clean rooms and excellent value for money.,"The room was a bit tight, we couldn’t open our suitcases on the floor, but hey that’s pretty normal in London."
8,Small but quaint. Very clean and the staff were very kind. Close to little convenience store and other restaurants.,The private toilets are not connected to the room... You got to walk back to the room to wash your hands. No elevators...so if you have a lot of luggage beware!
6,Location was excellent and the staff very helpful.,No lift and very small bathroom
6,Friendly clean,No lift on top floor
8,Property is in a great area. Price is just right.,Shower size. Not much they can change about it though so I understand.

8,"The helpful and friendly staff, the facilities, and the central hotel location. The en suite, bed linen, and wc was clean and fresh, the room had good lighting, ventilation and heating controls for comfort.. A compact but cosy room for one.",Maybe include a full length mirror as the dresser one was too low.
8,great location,shower was bit small
7,"Friendly staff, well organised, perfect location, early check in at no extra cost. Good security on the door.","Slightly small room, but for one night it was adequate.

8,convenient to Earls Court,The stairs and small toilet.
8,"Perfect location for our needs. On a nice, quiet square.
Friendly staff. Gave us early check-in.",Breakfast started too late to be of use. Dated/dowdy decor. Would have not been accessible if I had come with my disabled child
8,"The location of this hotel is perfect for short stays in London or connecting with the rail or an airport - near Paddington Station, mere meters/yards away from the Tube and the bus stations in the area, at walking distance from Hyde Park.
Please note - as most small hotels in this area, this is a very basic establishment - room is really small, the bathroom even smaller.
But unlike other places in the vicinity where I have stayed, this is a rather clean establishment, with very helpful staff. 
The reception closes at 8pm but you can still reach the guy in case of a problem very easily. No breakfast availble but it is perfectly OK if you buy some food from the nearby restaurants (some of them are really good) and bring it in the hotel to eat it in its breakfast room.","Nothing reallly, but still - pleae be aware: the rooms are really, really small. Nothing can be done about it with these hotels in old Victorian/Edwardian houses in this particular area. The shower cubicle might be rather tense for bigger persons. 
Oh, we had some noisy bathrooom ventilator in our room - it is connected to the bathroom light switch but stops vrooming whole 20 minutes after you kill the lights."

8,"perfect as a stop over when heading to Heathrow, 5 min walk. Nothing fancy, just everything you need. Clean and comfortable.",nothing to moan about other than the kettle was too big for when your trying to fill it up.
8,Helpful staff when on duty.,Room on 4th floor and no lift. Staff only on front desk 8.30am to 10.30pm
8,"The hotel is very well located, a 2 minute walk from Paddington station and Paddington high street. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the room, although small as they can be in London, was clean and comfortable.",The bed was a little too soft for my liking ... but that comes down to personal preference.
8,"The position is great, just 2 minutes from Paddington station and you can go everywhere","You can litterally hear every movement of the room next to yours, it seems they are in the room with you. Cleaningness could be improved."

The staff was friendly, helpful and very attentive to our every need. I would definitely stay here again.",No elevator in the building but the staff was happy to help with carrying baggage up the stairs which was appreciated. Extra space in the room was limited but most of our time was spent out in the city so that was not an issue.
6,"for staying alone for just few nights it is a great place, location close to the tube and as a teenager solo traveler felt safe even during the evening",(stayed in the fourth floor) if you’re a 6ft(and more) man you might not fit comfortably into the shower and the room generally
7,The location is great. Close to Paddington Station. Staff was very nice and helped with directions. Lovely view of a park out front.,Wifi was very spotty. My son said he could feel the spring being a bit poking.

8,"It is very close proximity to the Paddington station so an easy commute to all over London. Also had a nice row of restaurants, cafes and general stores nearby that are all quite pleasant!",A small downside is that there are no fans in the rooms (but all the windows open) and depending on the room they can be on the smaller side.
6,"The property was clean and our room was as described. 
Beds were comfortable. 
The gentleman who checked us in on our arrival was very friendly and helpful.",The property was a little tired in places. One of the plug sockets was faulty. There was only 1 spare pillow in a twin room.

Didnt cost much more than a bed in a hostel so was good value for money. 
I would stay again.","There's a lot of narrow stairs to the top floors so if thats an issue I would phone ahead to see what rooms are available. Also if in the single rooms luggage storage could be an issue, I had a small backpack and there wasn't really space for anything larger."

8,"Central location close to train stations. 
Very friendly staff.
Had everything we needed, as a base for exploring London.
Nice shops close by.","Slightly limited space in the small double room, but we knew it was going to be small so not an issue at all. Also stairs to rooms at the top can be tough after a long day of exploring."
7,Location was fantastic. Staff very friendly. Bed very comfy and the room was warm.,The room needed some work and tidying up. Room was on the top floor and the stairs were steep and narrow.

7,It was so close to Paddington underground and station to easily get around London. Close enough for a beautiful walk in Little Venice. The staff were very friendly. Good wi-fi - Nice view. Perfect to use just for sleeping.,Steep stairs to room ( we were on 4th floor). Decoration was dated. Facilities very tight to manoeuvre in room.
7,"The receptionist, a woman (don't know if she was the owner) was very helpful and really pleasant. Gave us anything we needed and helped us always with a smile",There's no lift in the building. We had the room at the top floor and it was like 5 flights of stairs. Not convenient with people with mobility/heart issues
8,"The room is basic, however it was extremely clean & the location is great. A 2 minute walk away from Paddington Station - an absolute life saver after a busy day walking London.

7,"Location beside Paddington station gave easy access to everything we needed. Walking distance from Hyde Park / Kensington. 
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Good selection of restaurants in immediate area of hotel both for dinner and breakfast.",Rooms are small and outdated however considering the price I paid I can have no complaints.
7,"The bed was very comfortable, and the staff was very nice and helpful. The location was fantastic, as it is just a 2-minute walk to Paddington Station.","The room was very small, but that was already expected since I saw the photos online before I booked, so not really a huge negative. Unfortunately, the water pressure is quite weak. There was an issue with the water temp on my first day, but that was quickly resolved by the friendly staff."
8,"Location was great for our needs, which was why we picked that hotel.

Closeness to the gardens in Norfolk square",Noise from the streets.
8,"Staff were very good, particularly the housekeeper who made sure each day that I had what I needed. 
Javed, on reception was very helpful in researching things for me.","The stairs were pretty steep, but then that's a feature of these old style multi story buildings"
8,The room decoration is good and the bedding is very clean. Convenient location and there are many shops/restaurants around,There is neither door nor partition for the very small shower area. It's a bit inconvenient because I was travelling with my son. He had to stay in the hotel's little patio out of the room when I was taking shower.
8,The location was excellent and the staff very friendly.,The rooms are very small and the bathroom tiny.

7,location was amazing and staff very friendly,bed was so soft and uncomfortable and shower was tiny
8,Very convenient and centralized.,Washroom is too small.
7,The staff were fabulous and very attentive and helpful. Sheets and towels were clean and fresh and done on request too. I personally liked the fact that no one went into you room unless you asked. We liked the fact the hotel stored our bags on our last day until we were ready to leave. Access to spare teas and coffee was good to replenish your room.,"I feel the whole place looked tired and is in need of a bit of TLC. Finishing touches where work had been done was not to a good standard and some of the features were an bit odd - two large mirrors in a room. There was a smoking area right by our window which meant we couldn’t have the window open, there is a lovely park across the way send smokers there with an ashtray."
8,location and staff,thin walls and room was very small

Room super clean, safe, peaceful on top floor.
Very helpful staff, as assisted promptly when locked out of hotel and room with electronic key card which I was not using correctly!","Room on v top floor accessed by a narrow windy staircase so be careful anyone with mobility issues. Landing area tiny for 4 rooms on top level, single room itself very small with tiny balcony , small single bed and ensuite ! Would chose a double room next time!"

7,"The position of the Hotel is amazing. Within 5 minutes of walking, there are the metro and train station, shops, restaurants, and bars. The neighborhood is very quiet and the view from the window is of a small garden, which is always beautiful. The staff is nice.","The room is a bit small. There is space just for the bed. Enough if you use the room only for sleeping and as a place where to crash the night. Finally, the shower and sink in the room are a bit small. If you are very tall, you might hit the ceiling in the shower."
8,"Friendly welcome
Clean comfortable small room 
TV kettle and shower","Thick glass so no view from window 
but it was ok for a short stay"
8,Location for London sights. Very close to Paddington Station,Well the fact no breakfast provided but had suspected that previously but facilities were available across the street
7,"Location is incredible because it is right next to Paddington station! The staff at the hotel were really nice, friendly and accommodating.","There are a lot of stairs, I was on the top floor which was 6 flights of narrow stairs. Difficult with a suitcase! Rooms are also quite small with dated furniture."

8,Nice clean small room with comfortable beds. Good location with lot of small shops and pubs just few steps far.,Thin walls between the rooms - we clearly heard everything from the room next to us.
7,I liked the price,"The only down side was the thinness of the ceiling.
People in the room above were walking around quite a bit and it was very noisy."
8,Friendly staff excellent location very good value,Small room but to be expected for price
8,Very close to Paddington station. Clean and tidy and very helpful. Beds were comfy,The toilet in our 3 person room was not much wider than the toilet and when you sat down and there was no room in front. A large person would really struggle. The bathroom was also very small
8,Big station very (Paddington) near and easy to move around. Lot of places to eat around. Hyde park is close. No trafik noice to the room.,Price level (e.g. breakfast) quite high (no breakfast in the hotel).
8,No breakfast provided. Excellent location,No continental breakfast as option
7,The location was/is the best point. The room was 'tight' but that's normal for cheaper priced rooms in a good locale. They supplied a good fan for the heat. There's no maid service but will supply extra towels etc on request.,"It is what it is. Sometimes, on short stays, a 'daily' maid service is unnecessary anyway."

8,"The location was great. 3 min from Paddington station and walking distance to main attractions.
The room was clean. it was rather small but so are all in London.
The staff was helpfull.",They didn't clean the room in any other day. They said to leave the towels on the floor outside the room if we wanted to change them so we did but in the evening when we came back they were still on the floor. But we talked to them and they cheanged them.
7,"Location was amazing, Paddington is a great place! Staff were friendly and the bed was really comfortable!","Room got really hot and stuffy, but we were there mid summer so not to bad."
8,"The location was fantastic, right beside Paddington station where we could easily get to anywhere else in the city from - definitely the best part of the accommodation. The room was small but comfortable, perfect for a few nights. Also, the staff were friendly and accommodating, allowing us to check in much earlier.",There was no breakfast available due to covid.
7,very good location and kind staff,it is rather old and small room
7,reception was pleasant. loved the key system - very up-to-date and safe. Nice color scheme in room. Comfy bed - very important! Locaation is great!!,"luckily I brought my own bar of soap! Not a big deal. some small improvements would be good.
one of the bedside lamps was broken - the light bulb worked but the lampshade was broken
I think a free bottle of water given the high temperatures in London during my short stay would have been a considerate gesture towards guests' well being. also the fan in my room, although adequate, did not have a button to stop it oscillating (well there was a button, but it was broken)"

8,The location in Paddington near the station and local restaurants was the main plus. The hotel was clean and bed was comfortable.,"The single room, shower and toilet were extremely small, but for the price of the room for the area it was ok. There was no space for a table for the kettle, it had to go on the floor when plugged in. No breakfast was available, but there were cafes within 100m."
8,Location great and quiet street. Access to all tube stations and buses was ideal. The staff was extremely wonderful. No breakfast yet due to Covid.,The floor in the room was slightly downhill and the plumbing in the bathroom was noisy and gurgled depending on whether other rooms showering or not. This didn't bother us tremendously but could bother other guests.
8,"walking distance from Paddington station, local England atmosphere ( not a big and un personal hotel) very nice and caring staff at the front desk, we felt very welcome :)",the bathrooms were a little bit small but worked perfectly.
7,"Nicely located close to Paddington train station which is great for people travelling through Heathrow. 
Norfolk square is a little green area close to some cafes and restaurants and not too far from Hyde Park.","The hotel does not have an elevator which might be difficult for some people. The bathroom was rather small which might also be a problem for some. 
As I travelled for business I had wished for better Internet which was dodgy in the whole area (couldn’t get stable net in the restaurant/ cafe, either)."
6,Helpful and amiable staff as i arrived after midnight!,The stairs’ but that’s only my fault not being fit enough! The bed was very comfy! But dated decor but for a budget was ok for the money
8,"Location was brilliant, 3 minute walk to Paddington Station and a few minutes walk to Hyde Park where you can hire bikes. Lots of places to eat nearby. Lovely helpful staff. A clean room which had everything we needed although it was quite small, however we only stayed one night so this wasn’t an issue. We had a good nights sleep, couldn’t hear any traffic noise. The hotel also looked after our bags during the day once we had checked out which was really helpful.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
7,"- Location is good
- Staff tried to be friendly
- Good value
- Generally feels clean","- Shower is not good, water pressure
- Not accept pay-wave; the whole payment experience is poor, not smooth
- Can feel a a bit weird of the layout; floor is not flat"
6,The staff were extremely friendly. The place was neat too.,"The pillows are two thin pillows fit into one pillow case, which is not the most comfortable. The toilet is also the size of an aeroplane toilet. Very small and not suitable for claustrophobic people."
7,very friendly and helpful staff,very small loft room
6,"Good location , cheap and. Cheerful",Beds bit uncomfortable
6,Location great. No breakfast in this hotel.,Room was very small but somewhat expected given that it is London! Price was right for what we got!! Great restaurants in the vicinity. Train stations and buses close by. Walking distance to Hyde park.
7,"Great location very close to the underground and railway station, very friendly staff, nice park in front of the hotel.","Very small room for two people, not enough space for two small suitcases, very thin walls - you could hear the neighbors from other rooms and from the corridor."
7,Tea and coffee facilities; very helpful staff at reception.,"Double rooms are spacious. Ensuite single bed room was very small, no desk or chair - storage space only for a large rucksack."
7,Our lady Mitra got our room ready and we could check in at 7:30AM!!! It was a godsend after not sleeping much on the plane. She was amazing!,"It was just too small. We knew it, but booked it anyway. After 5 nights we were going a little crazy. It's very noisy with the adjacent rooms. Paper thin walls."
6,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"The bed was too soft , when you lie iyou sink into it.... not much comfortale..."
7,"Great location, nice staff!","I had the single room which was realllly tiny but still, better than a hostel. A big cleaning would be nice (eg washing the curtains too)."
7,The Location is perfect! Right at Paddington Station. Lots of small restaurants and shops.,"Super uncomfortable beds. Suuuuper tiny bathroom. You can’t even turn around in the shower and I am not a tall person. 
Toilet was dirty, dark black hair on the bed ( we have blond and brunette hair)"
8,"The staff was really nice and helpful. The hotel is rather worn down but anyway clean. Nice free caffe/tea facilities also including small milk and sugar packings. Missing extra electrical outlets. (Only 1 was working). Very friendly, quiet and nice and super convenient placement. Will love to come back for a stay in the future",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.

7,"Position of hotel is very good, staff was very nice and kind and helpfull","High price, low comfort. Room was very small, bad smelling. Toilet and bathroom also very small."
7,"The location is excellent and the people in the reception are very nice and attentive, I got everything I needed within a few well put words.","It's probably London itself : the room is very little, the shower is a bit uncomfortable. For short stays though, I think is perfectly worth the value, it has everything you need."
7,Location,"The room was very small, bathroom too. could hear other rooms"
7,"Good location ,clean .","Very small room for 3 people,made it awkward to move around ,literally falling over one another..No window in the loo or shower."
6,The staff were very friendly (especially the morning receptionist) and the location was very central and easy for getting around the city. I do appreciate how they managed to squeeze everything you need into such a tiny room (the small coffee table is brilliant).,"The room was tiny, I knew this when I booked of course but I didn't realize just how difficult it will be to manage in such a tiny space with my suitcase. The decor is dated and kind of sad, could use a spruce. I also didn't feel like the room was clean enough (I got a shower gel and toilet paper roll that had already been opened by someone else!!!). The small balcony outside could have also been turned into a lovely sitting space but wasn't."
7,"- Very welcoming staff with heart for the customer. 
- My small issues were promptly addressed. 
- As a single traveller, I felt safe and secure.

- Opportunity to change towels daily 
- Radiator in the room that the customer can adjust as needed.","- The single rooms are very small and there's no space to sit and work with a computer. Only space to sit is the bed.
- Hardly any pressure in the shower.
- Cleaning could be better (hairs on the floor, stains on curtain and bed linen, shower, wash basin etc.)"
8,Hotel was OK for the price,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
8,"The staff (Mitra and James) are very friendly, helpful and nice. James helped with our heavy luggage. Both were always providing the assistance that we need.
Location of the hotel is very good. Very close to the Paddington Station. 
We took the Hop-on, Hop-off bus and it is just a minute walk away.
Many restaurants and shops around. It is also very close to Hyde Park.
It was a good 1 week stay for us.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
6,Good location,Outdated facilities
6,The Falcon is in a great position for trains and buses. The staff were very helpful.,There was only one spare power point in the room and it was under the desk. This made using the tea making facilities hard and charge up devices.
6,Good location. The ladies working the reception were really nice and helpful. Cheap for the location and for the middle of summer.,"The room was extremely small - no place really to put anything, so would probably only work for someone who is there to catch an early train from Paddington. No separate bathroom, just a shower and tap in the middle of the room, plus a toilet which was not really airing anywhere so did not smell great. Wi-fi did not work for the entire time of my stay, they gave me the password for another one, which worked, but not in my room as I was on the top floor. Very hot in the room. You could hear everything coming from the corridor, so when someone came home late or left early it was not great. They also started vacuuming at 8 AM on a Sunday just outside of my room, banging the door a couple of times with the vacuum. On the day of the check-out, the cleaning lady also knocked on my door a bit after 10 AM that it's time to go, and when I told her that the leaflet they gave says check-out is at 10:30, she told me ""okay, then 10 more minutes"". I understand that this hotel is cheap for the location, but putting up a few more shelves to make some space and having employees who are pleasant with the guests doesn't cost much."
7,Room was very clean - I peeled back the bed-sheets to examine the mattress as I always do to ensure no bed bugs or other unwelcome issue and that is always the main thing for me. It was only 1 night stay for work so was sufficient for my needs and location for Paddington is great! Staff were very friendly. It was also very quiet and no disturbance from other guests.,The room is dated and the mattress could do with replacing as its one of those when you sit down you disappear into it! It is also very very small.
6,Staff is amazing. Absolutely stellar!,"The room. It was very difficult to get in and out with any bags. The plugs were not reachable. The provide a kettle but u need to put in the floor to plug it in. The cord is too short. U dry your hair at a desk,but it’s awkward and tight. Lights above beds did not work. The noise in the building was insane. Hard to get luggage up the stairs. It was very expensive for what there was. The owner at the desk was so kind and the cleaner is a doll. That made up for it. They try very hard."
6,"The lication, the staff",the facilities
6,Location,Stairs.
6,Very helpful staff and a good location to get around town.,A triple room that was really a small double with an extra bed. The “bathroom” was a tiny prefab cubicle. The wifi was off and on and very slow when it was on.
6,"We did like that we had a tv, hangers and a kettle + tea/sugar/cups waiting for us in the room. The nearest tubestation was less then 2 minutes away, and has a good connection to Heathrow airport. It was also nice that we were able to drop off our bags on our last day in London, and come to collect them later.","the photo's on the site were very misleading. The room looked way larger than it actually was. The door to the shower was see through, and I was just traveling with a friend, not a spouse... The lavatory was very small, and we could not even properly fill your 0.5L bottle in the sink but had to do it with the cups in the room instead. The lavatory door didn't stay closed well unless locked. We had little space besides the bed and the small desk."
6,The hotel's location is great. It's 5 minute walk to central station Paddington with a lot of subway lines and train lines to go wherever you want.,"The room was very small and also the whole hotel have never been renovated, as a result making you feel like it's dirty."
6,"Location, Staff very friendly and helpful","Room size, Ensuite Size"
6,"The staff are very friendly and approachable!

Location is ideal for anyone looking to move around the city centre, as paddington is literally a street away.


The TV was modern and had apps such as Netflix loaded up that could be used.","I was in a basement room, and there was a pest bait station sitting on top of one of the bedside cabinets. No suggestion of any mice (room was clean), but certainly back of your mind when you see that.

I could hear everything in the room next to me.

The room was outdated and a lot of poor DIY to keep the place together. There was one plug under the desk for my phone charger and that was about it."
8,"It had a great location, very close to Peddington st. and Hyde Park. The staff was also really helpful and let us to leave our luggages after we checked out.","The main problem was with the cleanness because it was visible that the bathroom wasn't cleaned properly, maybe not at all. And the pillows weren't the most comfortable ones."

Location excellent. 
Good value for money given the price of London hotels",The toilet is separate to the room (shower and sink in the room). Not a big issue it's still a private toilet for that room (need a key to access) just down the hall. I didn't really mind it though.

10,"I liked everything about the room: comfortable bed, nice view from the bedroom window (from the top 4th floor), a cupboard to hang up clothes. Bin emptied daily if left outside and towels changed if needed. Tea/coffee making facilities with top-ups available in the entrance foyer. The shower was great and there was a separate toilet with its own door, plus a wash basin in a corner of the room. TV and charging facilities good. I could come and go as I pleased, with an electronic key fob which operated the bedroom and main entrance doors.","It didn't bother me (I liked the exercise), but the room was up 4 flights of stairs with no lift, so be aware of that. All the single bedrooms are on the 3rd and 4th floors."

9,A fantastic location only movements from the translation and short walk to tge tube. A variety of shops and vars?are off a peaceful norfolk square.,The top floor rooms are a good climb. Plan ahead to avoid having to nip back to your room.
9,"Location was superb; so close to Paddington station, and such a pleasant appeal from the front. The ladies on reception desk were most helpful and smiley.","Would have loved to see a couple of hooks in the bathroom - as simple as that, because everything else was spot on!"
9,"Location, you can walk to Hyde Park and Buckhingham palace. Neighborhood is safe.","Nothing, it’s the perfect place if you visit for first time and travel alone"
4,Location is amazing,"The stairs are a hazard. Even without luggage. 
The room had a tilted floor and the shower had no water pressure. There were instructions to “improve” it if the water suddenly stopped but I would have had better let getting the shampoo out of my hair my sticking my head out the window in the rain"
9,"Location. Quick and efficient check in. Easy check out. Perfect for what I wanted - a simple, affordable and very well located clean hotel for one night very close to Paddington Station",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
9,"The room is good. Just right size for single person. Just have to be careful when climbing up the stairs to get to the room. Luckily I was travelling with a carry-on luggage only. The location is also great, quiet and convenient as there are shops, restaurants and train station close by.",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
9,Just steps away from the metro station. A lovely little park right in front of the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff.,The bed is a bit too soft.
5,"Lovely Location, friendly staff, the place was kept very clean,","Six flight of stairs to a very small room, the shower was very small, as was the toilet, with the weather being very warm, the bed blanket was too heavy, need more options for bed clothing also need a fan to keep cool."
9,"Very close to Paddington train/metro, very close to numerous bus lines, around the corner from Big Bus Hop On Hop Off stop 39. Very close to corner shops/grocery and lots of restaurants and pubs. Room very clean, a little small for twin with 2 suitcases but we managed. Fan was provided when asked for as no air con as being very old terrace houses. Bathroom a little squeezy but okay for mum (81) and I (55) for a week. Water pressure great and shower temperature awesome as did not run hot/cold like many we had had around Europe. Had kettle and tea/coffee facilities in room and spares could be picked up anytime near reception. Even though room not serviced daily (they advised us of this when we got there) all we had to do was to leave rubbish bag and towels we wanted changed outside door of a morning. As we stayed for 7 days the sheets were changed day 4 when we asked. Lighting in room was great and bathroom had a fan. Opposite a little park area and in a very quiet street, our room faced onto the street and we slept with the window open every night with no issues. All staff were helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay here again.",Room not serviced daily so need to ask for toilet paper during the day before you run out at night. More an inconvenience than a dislike though. We were on bottom floor so did not need to go up floors but there are no elevator/lifts.
10,"I loved the location. The staff was wonderful. Very lovely. One suggestion though, have complementary coffee or tea at the lobby. It's really not feasiable to be making it in the room as the coffee itself is not that good ( the one in the room ) Thank you !","There are two things, walls are kind of thin so you have to either turn on the fan or play some white noise at night or youll be hearing all the walk around if your room is by the stairs. but its not the worst as far as issues. I still had a pleasant stay"
5,Great location really close to everything including restaurants cafes some nice bars and the underground.,No toilet in the room. Rooms are tiny but it is a budget hotel so can't expect too much.
10,"The hotel was perfect for a great sleep and has a great location, near to bus and metro stations. The staff was always friendly and helpful.",The lavatory used to covered with the water.

1,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"Very tight on space, The image of the individual room is different from the truth, it is very narrow and not suitable for a normal person"
9,Friendly and very helpful.,Duvet too narrow on a single bed.
9,"The Falcon hotel is a perfect choice to explore London and beyond for a few days, right next to Paddington station and lots of restaurants and shops to make your trip easy. The staff is the best, really nice and welcoming people, they made us feel at home.","The room and bathroom can feel a bit too small at first, but that's to be expected around here. You can rest just fine and it's not a problem really."
9,"Perfect location if you get off from Paddington, literally around the corner. We found it quiet with lots of restaurants nearby serving great food. All the staff were helpful and kind and happy.",Lots of stairs unless you are on the ground floor. If you have heavy luggage it’s a bit of a mission to lug it all the way up like we did but it was manageable.
10,"Great central location, ideal for exploring the city",London prices!!
9,"Great location - 5 mins to subway, 10 mins to airport bus
Silent place in a park
Great food options nearby
Close to all London attractions
Dining room and terrace","Very small sink - almost unusable
Noise from room above - walking etc. - probably due to wooden construction
Unusable fridge near reception - not freezing"
5,Prime location,We were in the basement we had 1 plug socket the toilet was smelly it seemed if anyone in the building went to the loo the smell came into our room via the toilet the flooring in the room was lifted in places and my daughter cut her foot at one point the room it’s self needs seriously updating

9,Location,Bathroom should be of larger size
9,"Adorable and helpful staff, good location, nice room 👍",Mattress was not too comfy to our taste
9,The staff was so sweet and especially the lady who welcomed us was so nice. I’ve been to London 5 times before on similar hotels and this service and treatment has been the best so far! Did not have high expectations to the rooms but they really surprised us and we had a room with a view overlooking the park - will go back again. We are a young couple in the mid twenties who went for a getaway and the location was perfect too,"The only thing was that a bit of air was coming through the window even when it was closed, but when we mentioned it to the lady at the reception, they fixed it the same day which was great!"
10,The kindness of the property!!,Little bit of the cleaning.

2,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,"no breakfast, common areas with carpet flooring and not cleaned"
9,Good location to the tube,The beds were not the best and we had ants in the room.
9,"Location was excellent, super close to Paddington Station which was great as we had a 6:30am train to catch and were able to walk there in just a few minutes. 
The room was larger than we expected, decent shower pressure too. The lady on reception who greeted us was really friendly and welcoming.","We were overall very happy with our stay, although if we had to critique one thing it would be that the bed was really too soft, but this is just our personal preference! Everything else that was great about it outweighs this small criticism"
9,"This is a good value assuming you don't intend to spend a lot of time in your room. My single-person room was tiny. There is barely room to walk around the bed. If you are a big person, you will feel cramped. However, all the necessities are there. A toilet, a sink, a tiny shower, a (twin) bed, small ceiling-mount TV,and wifi. You can't beat the location. Just a few minutes walk from Paddington Station. Which means easy access to food, shops, and tube/train. Staff was professional and pleasant. As long as you understand what you are getting into, I think this is a good value for the price paid, and I would stay here again.","As advertised, there is no elevator. You must be willing to drag your luggage up several flights of stairs, depending on the room you get. If you have accessibility issues, then don't stay here. Housekeeping is not daily."
9,location & friendliness,clean & room was perfect for one night.
9,Amazing price for location. Super friendly and helpful front desk staff. Ease of access to paddington station and Heathrow,"Okay, the shower IS small and low pressure but it isnt as bad as some other reviews make it out to be. It's a cheap and cheerful little place that's good for what you pay."
10,Friendly welcome. Super location. Central. Within easy reach of several bus routes and short walk to Paddington Station and Underground.,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,"Very convenient for Paddington Station, cheap for area.","I would call this a guest house not hotel, kInda run down and tired; single room tiny, as was shower cubicle. 
Arrived after midnight, I had notified them of my late arrival time in advance, was asked to pay £10 cash for this 'service'?? 
Need to be mega fit to lug suitcase up five flights of stairs - good exercise I think on a positive note."
4,"Nice staff, helping with information about surroundings, where to eat or have a drink. Doing their best to improve your accommodation. Comfortable beds. Close to underground station, train, bus","Dirty, smelly room, not enough ventilation. Very small toilets separated from the bathroom, no ventilation, if you are claustrophobic or over 100 kg please do not try. Dirty table, sticky and dusty. Not enough towels, please bring your own, same toiletries, no soap in the bathroom. Pillow cases inside out which made us wander if they were changed. Wi-fi available but very weak signal almost none. Cleaning needs a lot of improving."
5,"Location, location, location",Bed was on the small side. In hall WC was a pain
5,Staff was friendly,Room was extremely small and cramped
5,"Unbeatable, excellent location. Walking distance from Paddington Station, a short walk only takes a few minutes. A ton of restaurants and bars to choose from, gift shops and everything.","Tiny room and bathroom, probably the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in my life. It was difficult to to shower. No room service but they would change towels if you asked for it."
5,The staff were so friendly and helpful. The location to Paddington Station and restaurants was great.,"The hotel is very run down, uneven floor boards, extremely small room on 3rd floor with very narrow steep stairs. It would be so hot in the Summer."
5,"Location is excellent if you have an early train from Paddington. Clean and quiet, though. Shower good","Top room is truly the garret in the hotel. 77 steps, need to edge around the bed."
1,Location was good,"Room wasn’t very good in basement, no air"
1,The location,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,Location,"Room too small, looked like a children's room, maybe due to twin beds, double rooms much larger."
9,"Perfectly located, very friendly and helpful staff.","My room was tiny, but that's not unusual in London."
4,Good location to lords stadium for walking to the cricket.,"tiny room in what seemed like the basement of the property when we booked 5 months prior so I would of expected a better room. very stuffy with no air flow, yucky smell when the bathroom fan came on and a tiny shower also. Breakfast was meant to be included but apparently they no longer do breakfast. Beds were quite sunken and had a sore back afterwards."
5,"The location of this hotel is really the only thing it has going for it. Very convenient to Paddington Station, nearby restaurants and pubs. Despite having no bedside table it did have a good night light on the wall. The window opened fpr fresh air, which was nice.","My room was up 4 flights of stairs, a part of which becomes incredibly narrow and steep. There was no elevator nor any offer of assistance with my luggage. I am 65 years old and luckily traveling somewhat lightly on my ten day visit to the UK, but this hotel presented a real challenge in this regard. 
The room itself was very small. No bedside table. No extra blanket or pillow. There was one electrical outlet. There were no drinking glasses, no bottled water - only 2 coffee cups an electric kettle and tea/coffee packets.
The bathroom had a very small sink - no toiletries, not hand towel or face cloth. No soap at the sink and no shelf for toothbrush or other necessities. No hooks in toilet closet. The toilet was fine but no toilet paper roll holder. Toilet paper sat on the back of the toilet.
The shower had dispensers with body wash and shampoo. No conditioner.
This was a minimalist place to stay. The worst part was the climb up and down the stairs and concerns about what might happen if a fire broke out in the night. There was one very narrow way in and one very narrow way out. I didn't take photos, probably because I was so traumatized having to navigate the staircases with my bags."

9,Clean,Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.
5,No breakfast was available they had stopped serving breakfast since Covid,The bed was only 4’6” wide the floor in the room sloped. The room we were given did not seem like the one on the website.
2,Location,"The bed was tiny and extremely uncomfortable. The toilet hardly flushed. Had to keep asking for toilet paper as they supplied one only (no spare). When we asked for our room to be serviced, they only changed the towels and emptied the rubbish bin. They did not once clean the vanity bowl, toilet, shower or shelf in the bathroom. The floors were not swept."
4,Location,"No lift EXTREMELY small room for 3 people, bathroom on airplane was bigger"
3,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Single room on 3rd floor- no lift . Room was so tiny it Was hard to find anywhere to put my. Case down
1,Nothing,Everything about this hotel is bad
4,"The staff was every understanding and helpful, they were lovely and accommodating. The room had all the facilities advertised (wifi, shower, toilet, kettle with tea and coffee).","Despite the staff help, I cannot say that this was worth the money and I ended up booking elsewhere after the first night. I did not expect anything fancy but the single room was very very small - a box room with practically no space around the single bed and low ceiling, which felt claustrophobic. This may be what rooms are like in that area but I did not expect that."
5,Location was good near station,Lamp was taped up with duck tape making it a fire hazard. Not enough plugs had to unplugg tv to turn fan on and beds were very old and low.
2,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Room and bathroom extremely small. No bedsheets change for the overall stay
2,Location was excellent. The front desk staff was friendly.,"The room had no space at all. We couldn't fit in the room with the toilet, without our knees touching the door, and there was no bathroom fan. The drinking glass had caked on grime in the bottom. There were only sheer curtains on the window so you couldn't make the room dark to sleep. The room smelled of mold and mildew. The front staff was pleasant and tried to please, but there was no point telling them these issues as they couldn't fix them anyway (except the cup)"
4,"The location is convenient and staff were lovely. The room had the basic facilities like kettle, hair dryer, fan.","The single room was tiny at 2m by 2m square, including the toilet and shower. I couldn't even shut the toilet door when using the toilet because my legs didn't fit in the toilet stall. The shower was near impossible to use because it was so small. It felt more like a ship cabin rather than a hotel room. There was a gap under my door so I could hear everything outside the room."
4,Very central location near to Paddington station.,"Decent no-frills, budget hotel, but very noisy. The walls must be paper thin - I was able to hear lots of noises from the other guests, and the sound of the guests in the room above me walking around was enough to keep me awake (no fault of theirs, just no sound proofing at all)."
3,"The staff was nice and friendly. There was a fan provided in the room.
The location is great. Close to Paddington station. There is a park and many shops around.","While location is great, the hotel itself is very underwhelming.
The room is really cramped. The bathroom is the smallest I've ever seen. I can't even T-pose in it.
The floor was uneven and dipped down towards the middle of the room, like a valley."
3,Location was good,About everything else except for the lady at the reception who was really friendly and helpful
4,"the hotel is not recommendable. However, the location is very good - 10-15 min walking distance to hyde park and some cool bars/restaurants in the area.","Overall, can not recommend the hotel mainly based on the following factors: 
(i) cleanliness: towels and sheets in the bedroom were dirty
(ii) room: it was unbearably warm in the room. when it was 22-24 degrees celsius outside in the morning, it felt like 30 degrees in the room. There was no air conditioning and the fan was of limited use. 
(iii) service: the staff was anything but helpful. when we asked if they could call us a taxi, they told us to do it ourselves. There was no breakfast due to covid measures - although no one had to wear a mask."
4,Location,"The hospitality from the management and the bedroom on 4th floor, As i had a child and going up them stairs wasn't the best experience, also the bed wasn't comfortable as it was out dated and the room was really small for a family of 3. Also i had to pay extra payment just to change rooms to the ground floor and was rushed out the room on my departure day from the hotel."
5,Location is excellent,Beds not comfortable. It the best place to stay at but was a good option for the price we paid.
5,"The location is great, very central and the staff was very friendly.","The room sold as a room for three people was tiny. We were hardly able to move, the beds were not very comfortable and we did not get much sleep as it was very loud in the hotel due to the very thin walls (old pipes & other guests)"
4,Location of the hotel,Size of washroom is not at all feasible for family.
5,close to the metro station.,"no air con, fan not working, room exposed to the
sun so boiling hot."
8,"Sehr gute Lage. Restaurants, Supermärkte und Souvenirshops gleich in der Nähe. Ca. 3 Gehminuten bis zum Bahnhof Paddington und diversen UBahn-Haltestellen. Trotzdem ist es sehr ruhig. Ein kleiner Park ist direkt vor der Tür.","Eigentlich gibt es nichts, es muss einem bewusst sein das die Zimmer klein sind und man keine Probleme mit Treppen haben sollte."
8,Posizione e pulizia e disponibilità del personale,Il bagno della camera famigliare per 4 e’ piccolo
7,"La posizione ottima, a due passi dalla Stazione di Paddington e dalla fermata della metro Lancaster Gate. Il personale davvero gentile. All'ingresso c'è, a disposizione degli ospiti, una boccia d'acqua fresca e la possibilità di farsi the e caffè H24 e all'interno delle stanze il bollitore. Pulizia buona.","La stanza piccola e in particolare il bagno molto piccolo e diviso in due locali, uno per il wc e l'altro x la doccia con un lavandino minuscolo. Va comunque bene se ci si trattiene a Londra qualche giorno."

Certes elle est petite mais il y a tout ce qu’il faut sauf peut-être une étagère pour poser ses affaires. C’est un petit hôtel typiquement londonien, des escaliers étroits, une isolation qui n’est pas parfaite mais la gentillesse du personnel est assez unique.","Rien.

Y el grifo donde te lavas las manos del baño estaba sucio, se notaba que hacía tiempo que no se limpiaba, el portarrollos de papel higienico se caía todo el tiempo. Por último, se escuchaba todo el ruido de fuera como si estuviese dentro de la habitación. Parecía que la ventana estaba abierta porque el sonido se metía dentro, pero miraba a comprobarlo y estaba completamente cerrada. Era difícil dormir por eso."

Die Begrüssung war herzlich und die Angestellten sind sehr freundlich sowie hilfsbereit.
Die Zimmer sind klein und die Badezimmer ebenso aber funktional und reichen zum Übernachten vollkommen aus.
Es ist ein Hotel welches für einen Sigthseeing Aufenthalt in London perfekt ist. Kein Hotel um sich verwöhnen zu lassen. Ein reines ""Schlafhotel"" mit dem was man braucht: Bett & Badezimmer.",Das Bad dürfte wieder einmal sanft renoviert werden.

Mein Zimmer war ganz oben unterm Dach und sehr klein. Highlight war der Austritt ins Freie. (Es, ist kein Balkon, aber man konnte draußen stehen) Von hier aus blickt man in die Baumkronen des Parks. Früh am Morgen habe ich im Park 2 Füchse spielen sehen und die Eichhörnchen in den Baumkronen herumturnen. Allerdings war es schon eine sportliche Herausforderung das Zimmer zu erreichen. Das Treppenhaus ist recht eng und ich habe im Haus 77 Stufen gezählt, zuzüglich der 5 Stufen der Außentreppe, um ins Haus zu gelangen. Also insgesamt 82 Stufen um ins Zimmer zu kommen. Da überlegt man schon ganz genau, daß man nichts im Zimmer vergißt und ""schnell"" noch mal hoch muß. um beispielsweise einen vergessenen Schirm zu holen. Also im ernst: Für jemanden, der Probleme mit dem Laufen oder Treppensteigen hat, bzw. mit viel und schwerem Gepäck reist, ist diese Zimmer nicht geeignet. Für mich war es aber OK.","Die Matratze war für mich ein Albtraum. Sie war extrem dick und extrem weich und dabei noch ein wenig durchgelegen. Man kam sich vor wie in einem Wasserbett. Wenn man sich nachts herumgedreht hat, lief man Gefahr aus dem Bett zu rollen. 
Sicher, Matratzen sind Geschmackssache und vielleicht gibt es Menschen, die solche Matratzen mögen, für mich war sie aber nichts. 
Und vielleicht noch zwei Anregungen. 
Im Hotel wird kein Frühstück angeboten. Es gibt dafür aber im Zimmer einen Wasserkocher und dazu Tütchen mit Kaffee, Tee, Zucker und Kaffeesahne. Wenn es dazu noch einen Minikühlschrank gäbe, dann könnte man seine Frühstückzutaten darin lagern und hätte abends immer ein kaltes Bier. Das wäre toll.
Im Zimmer ist ein großer Fernseher mit unzähligen Programmen. Schön wäre aber, wenn es wenigstens jeweils mindestens einen Nachrichtenkanal in den wichtigsten Sprachen Europas gäbe."

6,"La ubicación es excelente. Se encuentra cerca de la estación y en una zona con muchos servicios, comercios y locomoción.
El personal es muy amable.","No tiene servicio de limpieza de habitación y no lo informan en la descripción del hotel sino en un apartado poco visible. Estuvimos seis noches y solamente limpiaron un día. Se argumenta que es cumplimiento de normativa por el COVID pero, no solamente ya finalizó la pandemia sino que la higiene es un factor fundamental para defenderse del COVID por lo cual no tiene sentido la argumentación. Por otro lado, otros hoteles de la misma ciudad incluso con menos estrellas informan que limpian diariamente. A mi entender es para abaratar costos. 
No tienen personal en recepción todo el día y tampoco es informado en lugar visible.
No debería tener clasificación de tres estrellas. Se sienten ruidos del resto de las habitaciones y caída de agua en forma constante."

Vooral Mitra was ontzettend behulpzaam.","Het enige wat vervelend was, zijn de krakende vloeren. Je hoort het heel goed als er andere gasten gaan lopen. Hierdoor werd ik wel elke vroege ochtend gewekt.

Como nuestra habitación estaba en semisótano la wifi no llegaba muy bien pero nos defendimos adecuadamente.

8,"El hotel se encuentra muy bien comunicado. 
El personal es amable y la habitación está limpia.
El hotel es acogedor y te dejan guardar las maletas tanto antes del check in como después del check out. Es muy tranquilo por lo que se puede descansar de manera correcta.
Tenéis que tener en cuenta que no hay ascensor y las escaleras son muy empinadas. Por esto es importante que miréis bien al reservar el tipo de habitación y donde se encuentra. En nuestro caso no fue un problema porque ya sabíamos que la nuestra estaba en la última planta y no nos suponía un problema. 
Otro aspecto es el tema de la amplitud de la habitación, ya de por si suelen ser pequeñas pero si elegís la habitación pequeña que sepáis que es muy pequeña, lo justo para dormir y ya, ya que apenas hay espacio para dejar una maleta en el suelo. Así que si solo vais para dormir está más que bien pero sino buscar una habitación más grande.
Relación calidad precio para lo que se ofrece en Londres y la zona está demasiado bien.","Presión de la ducha muy baja y una noche apenas salía agua caliente. 
La ventana no cierra bien del todo pero tampoco es un problema grave."

8,"Die Unterkunft war einfach perfekt! Das Haus hat einen ganz besonderen Charme, da es sich um ein altes englisches Stadt-Gebäude handelt, das mit viel Liebe renoviert worden ist und gepflegt wird. Natürlich sind die Räume kleiner als man es in Deutschland vielleicht gewohnt ist. Dies gehört aber zu dem typischen Charakter dieser Gebäude und macht letztlich auch den besonderen Charme aus. Und auch auf dem kleineren Raum ist alles da, was es zur Bequemlichkeit braucht: Ein großer LED Fernseher, ein Schminktisch mit Föhn, Wasserkocher mit Kaffeepulver und selbstverständlich Teebeuteln, Shampoo und Duschgel… Und die Betten sind unglaublich bequem. Sie sind weich und dennoch stützen sie stabil den Körper und sorgen so für einen tiefen Schlaf. Zimmer und Waschraum sind sauber und gepflegt. Frühstück gibt es aufgrund der Pandemie-Lage nach wie vor nicht. Aber genau gegenüber sind zwei Kaffees die ein absolut leckeres Frühstück zu einem guten Preis anbieten. Apropos Preis: Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis im Falken Hotel ist super! Ein so schönes und liebevoll geführtes Hotel in derart optimaler Lage findet man zu diesem Preis selten.
Die Lage des Hotels ist perfekt, um London zu erkunden. Um die Ecke ist der Paddington Bahnhof, von dem aus viele U-Bahnlinien in alle Richtungen der Stadt führen. Und so sind alle Sehenswürdigkeiten Londons gut und schnell zu erreichen.
Auch das Personal war absolut liebenswürdig und ständig in Sorge, dass man sich auch wirklich wohl fühlt. Ich habe hier negative Bewertungen gelesen, die ich nicht nachvollziehen kann. wenn ich den Standard eines Fünf Sterne Hotels erwarte, dann muss ich mir die entsprechende Unterkunft suchen. Das bedeutet aber nicht, dass das wunderschöne Stadthotel zu kritisieren wäre. Auch die herbe Kritik in Abrechnungs-Angelegenheiten erschließt sich mir nicht! Auch wir hatten da eine andere Vorstellung. Aber nachdem wir gefragt haben, ob wir dies auch anders handhaben können, so war das überhaupt kein Problem!",Отрицательный отзыв отсутствует.

Für die Treppen (3. Stock) sollte man gut zu Fuß sein. Das Bad in unserem Zimmer war wirklich sehr klein (auf dem Klo sitzend Zähne putzen und duschen gleichzeitig geht sicher) und die Lüftung sehr laut und lief sehr lange. Das Zimmer insgesamt auch sonst sehr beengt. Das Mobiliar ist eher abgewohnt, aber es war sauber. Insgesamt würden wir aufgrund der Lage und des Preises wohl wieder kommen."

Ich habe gesehen, dass das Bad nachträglich eingebaut wurde und es ist klar, dass mehr Platz dafür nicht vorhanden war. Es ist auch gut, dass überhaupt ein eigenes Bad zum Zimmer gehört, aber hier wird ja gefragt, was mir nicht gefallen hat."
7,La ubicación muy buena muy cerca de la estación de metro,El baño es muy pequeño y las escaleras muy estrechas y empinadas.
7,"Localização perfeita, a um quarteirão da Estação Paddington que te leva para todos os lugares. 500m do Hyde Park e pontos de ônibus bem pertinho. Nas ruas próximas ao hotel tem muitas acomodações, restaurantes, lanchonetes, mercados, pubs. O hotel fornece lugar para guardar bagagem, após checkout e água/chá na recepção 24hrs. Chuveiro quente, com bastante pressão e secador de cabelo funcionando, mas precisa levar o adaptador. O pessoal da recepção é simpático.","Já sabia que o quarto era pequeno, pois a intenção era ter um espaço seguro, limpo, central e econômico. No entanto, se for uma pessoa mais fortinha e alta não entra no box do banheiro (tenho 1,57). A pia é minúscula, tampa do vaso estava solta, não tem tomada perto da cama, as tomadas perto da cômoda só uma funcionava e eu avisei a recepção. Mas o que me surpreendeu foram as 7 escadas até o meu quarto de número 20. O hotel possui outros quartos melhores nos primeiros andares com custo maior. Se quer economizar e apenas um local seguro para dormir, esta é uma opção."

7,"Locatie was top; restaurant, winkels en metrostation waren op loopafstand. Manager was heel behulpzaam en klantvriendelijk en hotel was redelijk betaalbaar.","Hotel was erg gehorig, badkamer was erg klein, kamer had geen koelkast en hotel had geen lift, maar daar was de prijs ook naar en voor 6 dagen is dat prima vol te houden."

Onze kamer liep hol / scheef waardoor bedden ook niet echt recht stonden."
7,"La situació és moot bona. A 3 minuts a peu de l’estació de Paddington amb diferents linies de metro i estació de tren. 
El barri molt tranquil. 
La dona de l’hotel molt agradable i servicial.
Bullidor d’aigua amb té i cafè i potets de llet a l’habitació. Aigua a recepció. Aquedts detalla s’agraeixen molt.
Pots deixar les maletes el dia del checkout","Les habitacions molt petites. El bany prefrabricat.

8,Положительный отзыв отсутствует.,Die Zimmer waren extrem klein.
6,"Muito bem localizado em termos de transportes.
Zona com comércio local agradável.
Perto do Hyde Park.
Apesar dos comentários negativos (abaixo) tem boa relação qualidade preço. Em circunstâncias semelhantes (a viajar só) não me importo de repetir.",O quarto era minúsculo sendo difícil até de uma pessoa se movimentar. Para uma pessoa mais idosa ou mais pesada será muito difícil aceder ao quarto. Há lanços de escadas muito inclinados e estreitos. Para uma pessoa em boas condições físicas isso não será problema e suponho que os quartos do nível mais alto sejam os menores. Vi outros quartos (de casal) bem melhores.

Da curare un po’ di più la pulizia, ma nel complesso è sufficiente!"
7,"La posizione ottima (a pochi metri dalla stazione metro e treni di Paddington), la gentilezza dello staff (ci hanno fornito più asciugamani)il letto era comodo. La camera silenziosa nonostante affacciasse su di un ""cortile"" interno.
La possibilità di poter usare un PC messo a disposizione per i clienti e di poter lasciare le valigie il giorno del check out.
L'orario del check out comodo (oltre le 10.30).","La finestra era rotta e tenuta aperta con una gruccia per abiti, le prese scarse e malfunzionanti (scintille), il sotto dell'asse del wc era sporco, asciugamani scarsi (solo 1 grande per la doccia), no ascensore (attenti alle valigie troppo pesanti).
La vicinanza tra le camere dava poca privacy (la mia dava sul letto di un altro ospite) + costante odore di fumo sempre nello spazio esterno. 
La mamma della metro non è aggiornata (dettaglio all'apparenza insignificante ma fa riflettere dato che una mappa costa poche sterline..)"

6,L accueil et le quartier,"L absence de rideau occultant, la lumière rentrant dans la chambre toute la nuit c était très embêtant"
6,"Skvělá poloha u nádraží Paddington. Na přespání dostatečné. Miniaturní pokoj, sotva projdete kolem postele = Londýnský standard, ale v zásadě OK.","Vysoká cena (asi také kvůli tomu, že se tento víkend běžel London Marathon a město bylo plné). Bez výměny ručníků, problém s vynášením odpadků."
6,"Me pareció genial la ubicación, un barrio tranquilo muy cerca de la estación de paddigson y muchos comercios. El personal muy amable.","No me gustó que era en la última planta con escaleras realmente pequeñas, la habitación era muy muy pequeña, sin espacio casi para dejar las maletas."

6,La ubicación y la atención del hotel,La cama individual era un poco dura y el baño muy pequeño
6,La posizione centrale; l'heathrow express parte da Paddington che è a 5 minuti dell'albergo.,La camera era al quarto piano senza ascensore e con le ultime rampe di scale molto strette; la stanza e'minuscola (non c'e il bagno separato: la doccia e' a vista in stanza; il wc nell'armadio). non c'era praticamente lo spazio per aprire la valigia. Non forniscono il sapone (ho usato i 2 mini flaconcini di bagnoschiuma forniti). Ci sono però stanze più grandi.

La chambre - bien que petite - etait propre et bien équipée. 
Le personnel est très sympathique.",La literie : le lit était trop mou et les oreillers trop durs. Nous n'avons pas hyper bien dormis...
7,Det var centralt och väldigt mysigt!,Toaletten va i det minsta laget men det kan också bero på att jag är 190 lång!
6,"La ubicación, justo al lado de la estación de tren.","No teníamos grandes expectativas sobre los alojamientos en general de Londres y este no nos sorprendió. Pensamos que por la fotos merecería la pena alejarse del centro pese al precio pero no. El baño estaba sucio, se notaba la falta de mantenimiento en toda la habitación en general. Nos tocó en el cuarto piso subiendo tramos de escaleras muy estrechos y empinados. Para nosotros no fue problema, pero quien lleve maletas grandes y pesadas puede pasarlo mal."

Wir sind uns sehr sicher, dass als wir gebucht haben es Frühstück in dieser Unterkunft geben sollte, ganz unten in der Bestätigungsmail steht aber das es keines gibt. Wir hatten uns extra für dieses Hotel aufgrund des Frühstücks entschieden. Als wir zuletzt die Webseite des Hotel gecheckt haben, stand auf dieser auch das es Frühstück gibt. Gibt es aber nicht."

Unsere Nasszelle war max. 1,2m² mit Dusche, Toilette und Waschbecken. Der Preis ist einer der günstigsten und man will ja eigentlich auch nur dort schlafen, aber max. 50cm um das Bett rum ist doch ziemlich mühsam. Wir hatten ein 3er Zimmer.

Es war auch alles sauber und gepflegt, machte einen sehr guten Eindruck. Die Lage vom Hotel ist super, da man in 2 Minuten an der Paddington Station ist, wo man auch direkt einen Sainsbury und weitere Einkaufsmöglichkeiten hat. Man hat außerdem kein hohes Verkehrsaufkommen oder Krankenhäuser/Polizei/Feuerwehr in der Nähe, wodurch es sehr ruhig ist.","Das einzig schade, aber verständliche ist, dass seit COVID-19 kein Frühstück mehr angeboten wird.

Y cerca de muchos lugares a donde se puede llegar caminando tranquilamente: hyde park, picadilly, etc. El personal es muy amable y te ayuda con lo que precises. La cama es cómoda y si bien (al igual q la mayoría de los hoteles en Londres) los espacios son reducidos y se debe acceder por escaleras es un hotel que cumple con la relación calidad-precio.

Η κυρία στη ρεσεψιόν υπέροχη και πολύ εξυπηρετική, πρόθυμη να μας βοηθήσει και να μας εξηγήσει κάθε λεπτομέρεια. Πολύ εξυπηρετικό ότι δεν είχαμε αντάπτορες και διαθέτουν στο ξενοδοχείο προς πώληση και σε καλή τιμή. Γενικά υπήρχε πάντα διάθεση να μας εξυπηρετήσουν σε οτιδήποτε θα μπορούσαμε να χρειαστούμε.

Kunde definitivt tänka mig att bo på detta hotell igen under framtida London-besök.","Pga att rummet var på översta våningen samt värmeböljan i London, var mitt rum alltid väldigt varmt.

O Hyde Park fica a dois quarteirões do hotel. Parque lindo e com restaurantes e área de lazer para crianças. O quarto e a cama são confortáveis. Fiquei no quarto 6 bem no começo da escada e achei que fosse te problema com barulho, mas não me incomodou. A parte do banho do banheiro é muito pequena, mas deu tranquilamente para tomar banho sem dificuldades. O quarto e banheiro bem limpos. Não usei café da manhã, mas no quarto deixam sachê de café e chá e na recepção também tem água, chá e café para se servir. Melhor custo benefício.",Tudo ok para mim

9,"La ubicación no puede ser mejor. Justo al lado de Paddington y de Hyde Park, lo que a mi gusto lo hace ideal para familias con niños. Precio muy competitivo para ser Londres. Comparado con España es caro, pero es que Londres es carísimo, así que el precio de este hotel, muy bien. Muchísima oferta gastronómica justo al lado del hotel, paradas de autobús, farmacia, ... La habitación familiar con camas que aunque en principio parecen demasiado blandas, a la hora de dormir son muy cómodas. Televisión, ventilador, secador de pelo y juego de hervidor de agua y café. Baño minúsculo pero correcto con gel y champú. El personal súper amable preguntando siempre si necesitábamos algo. Incluso una noche tuvimos un pequeño problema y vinieron enseguida a solucionarlo y al día siguiente nos hicieron la habitación, lo cual se supone que no hacen nunca. Pero cada mañana te preguntan si necesitas algo. En definitiva, me ha parecido genial y repetiría sin duda.","La única pega, la falta de cortina opaca en una de las ventanas de la habitación. Amanece muy pronto y a pesar de estar en el sótano entra la luz. A mi no me importaba demasiado, pero habrá gente a quien sí le moleste."

Polštáře byly docela tvrdé. Do pokoje vedlo úzké schodiště (po celodenní chůzi docela výšlap:) Jsou slyšet kroky a splachování ze sousedního pokoje. Na manželské posteli byla jen 1 přikrývka, avšak na požádání jsme dostali další."

5,"La ubicación es inmejorable, cerca de estación de metro y buses. También bastante cerca de muchos puntos turísticos centrales. Para un viaje corte en Londres y con buen tiempo (nosotros fuimos en abril y no nos llovió, pero si hacía algo de fresco), te puedes alojar aquí. En caso contrario no lo recomiendo. La habitación es enana (nosotros somos una familia de 4 con dos niños). Sin embargo, la habitación estaba limpia. Si quieres descansar un poco durante el día en la habitación del hotel se te viene todo encima. El baño increíblemente pequeño, con muchas cosas a mejorar. Las camas algo cómodas, pero las almohadas no! La señora de recepción super simpática.","La habitación muy pequeña, bastante incomodo estar dentro del hotel y de la habitación. Suerte que solo estábamos para dormir. No es un hotel de tres estrellas en mi opinión. Lo único bueno es la ubicación."

Het is erg gehorig. 
Er zat een raam in onze kamer dat niet gesloten kon worden, gasten uit andere kamers kunnen zo van de buitenkant onze kamer in, en zouden zo bij onze bagage kunnen komen.
Ook rook onze kamer sterk naar riool toen er op de verdiepingen boven ons gedoucht werd. 
Op de laatste dag werden we om 06:30 wakker omdat de schoonmaaksters naast onze kamerdeur hun karren stonden te laden."
1,"solo la atención de recepcionista asiática. Nada del hotel, (con minúsculas) Boking lo cataloga 3 estrellas. Solo 1 y apagada. No limpian la habitación qué tiene baño dividido en 3 partes. Inodoro a 9 metros de la habitación y 8 escalones más abajo, con llave xa que no lo use otro, mientras dure tu estancia. Un lavabo chiquito en la esquina de la pequeña habitación. Como si fuera un placar en la otra esquina de 75 x 75 cm., la ducha. De acuerdo al piso que te toque, entrená piernas, xq' no hay ascensor. Volvimos y la puerta estaba abierta de par en par. No habían robado nada. Vergonzoso. 
Es la 2° vez que Boking me engaña. (La anterior, en Oruro -Bolivia-, Carnaval x un pésimo hotel, nuevo xo alejado) de calificación 4 estrellas, lo reservamos x U$s 200, pensando en que se parecía al Sherathon de Dallas (igual precio). Tan distante en calidad y atención, como la ciudad de Dallas a Oruro...","Salvo la recepcionista (oriental), no conozco su nombre, que fue eficiente, todo lo demás, no me gustó."
3,Superbe emplacement à 5 min de Paddington et quartier calme avec restaurants et commerces,"Manque de confort dans la chambre (lit extrêmement mou, moisi dans la douche, sol de la chambre en pente, propreté qui laisse à désirer). On ne peut pas circuler dans la chambre, il y’a des plaques métalliques autour des meubles, il faut faire attention à ne pas se blesser. Le jour du départ on peut laisser les bagages à l’hôtel mais dans une pièce non fermée où tout le monde a accès (il semblerait que des personnes dorment dans cette pièce, il y’a des matelas contre un mur et des vêtements qui traînent). Chambre au 4ème étage sans ascenseur il faut avoir la condition physique surtout pour porter les bagages. Accueil des gérants pas terrible. J’adore Londres mais honnêtement cet établissement est à fuir, tout est fait pour prendre un maximum d’argent avec un minimum d’investissement."

La situation géographique est très bonne avec la gare, station de métro et bus à 4 minutes à pied.","La chambre était propre à l’arrivé mais le ménage n’a pas été fait durant nos 5 jours à l’hôtel. Les chambres sont très mal isolés. Le monsieur de la réception de hier était pas sympa, je lui ai demandé du papier toilette car la femme de chambre n’en avait pas remis et il m’en a donné en râlant.

4,"Bon emplacement et personnel très agréable 
une lumière ne fonctionnait pas à notre arrivée, le lendemain le nécessaire avait était fait et tout fonctionnait","chambre très petite et très peu isolée
murs très fins, on avait l’impression d’être dans la même chambre que nos voisins… 

propreté à revoir dans toute la chambre : mouton de poussière au sol, salle de bain, linge de maison (tâches, cheveux/poils qui ne nous appartenaient pas)
même la propreté de la bouilloire laissait à désirer

lits à ressorts inconfortables

6 réseaux Wifi dont un seul qui fonctionne et que l’on ne captait pas dans notre chambre…"

8,"Location is perfectly and conveniently located near major transport hub - St Pancreas and Kings Cross, as well as 2 other tube stops within easy walking distance. Area is safe with lovely pubs, coffee shops and restaurants. Sweet compact flat for 3 adults - flat is on 4th floor, but building has a lift if needed. Host was extremely responsive and accommodating. Host provided a rack for drying clothes after using the washing machine which was great. Lovely welcome gift of a few treats was a nice surprise.","Washroom was quite dark so additional lighting would be helpful. The sofa bed is located in the small TV room with no allowance to store personal items. Perhaps a small side table or compact clothing rack to accommodate clothing and personal belongings for person using that space. A mirror as well would be great. 
Fairly close to a hostel and could be a little noisy at night."
6,"Great location, good check in.",Sparsely furnished- for example no table or anywhere to place things. Light bulb not working in bathroom. Over priced.
